<h1>ARGENTINA AND URUGUAY<br />
<span class="smaller">BEFORE THE WAR AND AFTER</span></h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>

<p>A tale of the Pampa<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> tells how a River Plate
farmer of bygone days, seeing his wife and child
dead of pestilence and his pastures blackened by
fire, fell into a magic slumber born of the lethargy of
despair.</p>

<p>He was awakened, many years afterwards, by the scream
of a railway engine at his boundary; to find his land fenced
in, his flocks and herds improved beyond recognition, and
maize and wheat waving where only coarse grass had been
before.</p>

<p>This allegory is true.</p>

<p>It tells the whole story of the real development of the
River Plate Territories, a development in which the descendant
of the original settlers has but comparatively
recently begun to take an active part.</p>

<p>He, the Patriarch of the soil, lived on his land while
English capital and Italian labour opened up its treasures
to the world. In the beginnings of Argentina as a nation,
his property consisted of vast herds of long-horned, bony
cattle, valuable only for their hides, which roamed the
Pampa in savage freedom; untended, save for periodic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
slaughter and skinning and the yearly rounding up for
the marking of the calves.</p>

<p>Later, came the acknowledgment between neighbours,
living at vast distances from one another, of boundaries
which indicated the huge areas over which each had grazing
rights. Later still came the time when the more far-sighted
of such men bought wire and, with <i lang="es">quebracho</i> posts, ringed
in those areas as their own. The foreigner and his railway
did the rest to build up the huge fortunes of the children
and grandchildren of those far-sighted Patriarchs. For
Patriarchs they were, Pastoral Kings surrounded by half-caste
<i lang="es">gauchos</i> who lived in the familiar vassalage of the
great mud-walled, grass-thatched house, and spoke in the
familiar second person singular still in use among Argentines
towards their servants; otherwise only employed between
members of the same family or close friends. Until a very
few years ago, these great Argentine families constituted
Oligarchies which ruled almost absolutely each over one of
the more distant Provinces, the people of which were the
descendants of the vassals of their forefathers. The full
power of these Provincial Oligarchies was only broken by
the centralizing policy of President Dr. Figueroa Alcorta
(1906 to 1910). The curtailing of their power was very
necessary for the credit of National Finance and Justice, for
that power was often exercised with a mediæval high-handedness
unsuited to twentieth-century ideas.</p>

<p>The disintegration of the power of local Oligarchies, each
of which completely dominated the Congress of its province,
was one of the final but quite necessary steps towards
putting the house of Argentina into perfect political and
financial order; especially as Provincial Governors, hitherto
always members of the Oligarchic families, were also almost
invariably members of the National Senate. Add to these
considerations the further one that the Provincial Courts
had somehow or other gained a reputation for not meting
out justice to political friend and foe alike, and that much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
complaint was heard about the difficulties encountered by
some persons in even working the way of their cases up to
the admirably impartial hearing of the Federal High Court
of Appeal; since, for instance, it is difficult to appeal from
a decision which has not been given, and which you seem
to possess no means to obtain, even as against you.</p>

<p>All these inconveniences and scandals had long called
imperatively for reform, but it was reserved for Dr. Figueroa
Alcorta to discover the way to successfully bell these
powerful provincial cats.</p>

<p>The way he found (which is referred to more fully in a
later chapter) was essentially South American; but, as
many things in South America which at first sight appear
strange to European eyes do, it worked very well.</p>

<p>It is desirable here, however, to make quite clear the
fact that any political South Americanisms which may still
survive in Argentina are strictly confined to her internal
and local politics and administration. Within that sphere
it might almost be said that only the Judges of the Federal
High Court of Appeal keep themselves completely clear of
any shadow of suspicion. If you get to the Federal High
Court you have the Law of the Land administered with unflinching
impartiality. The only leaning of which that
Tribunal has ever been accused (and that only jokingly) is
that of an inclination to decide against the Government.
Because, its judges, once appointed, cannot be removed
unless on the ground of gross misconduct; whereas all other
functionaries in the country are more or less liable to feel
the effects of political influence. The National foreign or
commercial policy is also as transparently pure and fair as
it is possible to be. Argentina knows her best interests much
too well to seem even to offend against European ethical
standards in anything which touches external policy or
Foreign interests, however remote.</p>

<p>As for her internal politics, these have been, until very
recently, at all events, left by common consent of foreigner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and native alike to the sweet will of the caste of professional
politicians. These people intrigue for place and profit and
have vicissitudes, triumphs and defeats, without the real
wealth-producers of the country knowing or caring one way
or another. The doings of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture
(embracing Commerce and Industry) and Public
Works and the legislation affecting matters appertaining
thereto are all that matter to the Bankers, Traders and
Agriculturists or the great Railway Companies; and these
leading Official and Commercial and Industrial Classes are
the only people of real consequence in the land; unless one
adds the Municipal Authorities of the Cities of Buenos Aires
and Bahia Blanca.</p>

<p>The actual Government, however, is jealously kept in
native patrician hands. If one finds a foreign name in the
list of high officials it may safely be assumed that the
bearer of it is connected by marriage with one of what may
be called the great ruling Argentine families, with names
recurrent in the country’s History.</p>

<p>These families constitute the real aristocracy of the
Republic, and are mostly possessed of very great wealth.
Kind and sympathetically courteous to the stranger as are
all Argentines, one cannot but smile when one finds writers
implying that entrance into Argentine Society is easily
effected by anyone who, as I once saw it stated, could play
a good hand at bridge.</p>

<p>As a fact, no stranger ever becomes a member of the
best Argentine Society; he may find himself in it at brief,
fleeting moments, but he is never of it. As in the aristocracies
of the old world, all its members are connected
more or less remotely by blood or marriage, usually both,
with one another. One may know intimately many men
prominent in Argentine Society, may be received by them
at their houses now and again and mingle there with other
men, their kindred; but the charming conversation one
enjoys when there is not that which was going on when one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
entered, and will continue after one has left again. Argentine
ladies only receive on set, formal occasions; unless in
such public places as the Palermo Race-course or the Rambla
at Mar-del-Plata. Small and select dinners take place rather
at the Jockey Club than in private houses. Under a somewhat
effusive external manner, the Argentine has all the
reserved exclusiveness of his Spanish ancestors. Gold has
its weight in Argentina as elsewhere; but it has more
efficacy as a key to society in many European capitals than
in Buenos Aires; notwithstanding the almost childish fondness
of Argentines for the display of their own wealth, a
characteristic which makes them (and other Americans)
beloved in Hotels and Restaurants throughout the world.
The one characteristic for which the Argentine does not get
full credit from the superficial observer is the very strong
vein of common sense which underlies his more immediately
noticeable affectation of manner and behaviour. A great
deception is always in store for those who do not appreciate
the fact that the most boisterously extravagant Argentine
never really loses sight of the fact that 2 and 2 make 4 and
no more and no less. Yet this should be apparent in a
nation which has known so well during the fifty or sixty
years of its real development how to let the foreigner work
out that development at a good profit for himself, of course,
but at a much greater one for them. The Argentine, while
availing himself of every advantage derivable from the influx
into his country of foreign Capital and Labour, has never
really loosed his hold on his own independent Government
nor the land. His land is and has always been the source of
his fortune, and to his land he clings with unrelaxing
tenacity. If there is a good bargain to be made in real property,
it is an Argentine who immediately takes advantage of it to
increase his probably already large holding.</p>

<p>He it is who most readily lends money on mortgage, at a
high rate of interest, on real property. He knows only of
one way in which to invest the surplus of his income—in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
land or the things intimately connected with land and its
immediate productivity. Agricultural enterprise he understands
and daily appreciates more and more its scientific
working. Intensive farming is already practised by him in
those parts of the country where land is most valuable.
He breeds as fine cattle and sheep as any foreign breeder or
colonizing company.</p>

<p>But for commerce other than purely agricultural he has
no bent. So he wisely leaves it in the hands of the stranger,
who thereby develops his towns, and builds railways and
tramways; all of which go to the enhancement of the values
of Argentine real property.</p>

<p>Now and again there is a pseudo-patriotic clamour in
certain sections of the Native Press over what is denounced
as the exploitation of Argentina by the foreigner. But all
this is mere froth born of journalistic need of “copy”:
mere great-gooseberry matter for a dull season. That it is
no more was proved a few years ago by the great English
Railway Companies.</p>

<p>They became weary of being denounced as the worst kind
of exploiters of an innocent bucolic people; and, in reply,
published broadcast an announcement that they would
transfer a certain large quantity of their shares at par (the
market price being considerably higher) to Argentines who
might thereby qualify themselves not only for a share in the
Companies’ profits, but for seats on the Boards of Directors;
where they could have a voice in the management of what
was being denounced as a vast system of exploitation. To
this very liberal, almost quixotic, offer there was no response.
For the simple reason that, whilst the railway
dividends did not exceed 7%, land mortgages carried 10%
or 12%, and the yield from immediate agricultural enterprise
proportionately more.</p>

<p>Every branch line opened by the railways, often at huge
expense of expropriation, spells fortune to Argentines. If
the railway gains in a less degree who should complain?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
No one really does, everyone really concerned being much
too well aware on which side his own particular bread is
buttered. As I have said, the Argentine is possessed of a
quite preponderating amount of common sense.</p>

<p>His attitude towards the foreigner is, “I give you all
liberty and protection for any enterprise you may wish to
carry out in my country, by which you may become very
rich; but the country itself and nearly all the land in it is
mine and will remain so.”</p>

<p>The last thing the Argentine will part with as an individual
or as a nation is land.</p>

<p>Grants of fiscal lands were made in the past with scandalous
liberality for political services, but to Argentines.
Mighty little of such lands, none of any, then, apparent
value, went to foreigners; whatever they might have done
for the country’s development and good. Now, few grants
of such lands are made to anyone; the National and Provincial
Governments appreciating too fully the advantages
of their retention as aids to power and wealth.</p>

<p>In all this the Argentine is right from his natural point of
view; but his obstinate maintenance of it is gradually
bringing certain economic problems of vital importance to
a stage when some way will have to be found out of the
dilemmas which they already present.</p>

<p>The chief of these problems is that of agricultural labour.
What inducement does Argentina offer to the class of
colonist she needs most, the man with a wife and family to
aid him in his work and with, perhaps, a small amount of
Capital?</p>

<p>He will find plenty of work and people to employ his
labour at a liberal wage as soon as he lands. He will be
taken, if he so wish, free of all cost to himself, to one or
other of the more or less distant parts of the Republic,
where he may be set to work on virgin soil at a wage, or,
may be, on a half share of profits for a period of three years.
On the scene of his industry he will find an Italian or Galician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
storekeeper who will supply his every reasonable want on
credit, taking as security the share to come to him of the
profits from the land to be worked. The storekeeper will
also charge a high rate of interest on prices of his own fixing,
unembarrassed by any competitors within a radius of very
many miles; or, if there be such, he and they will know well
enough how to preserve a rate of profit which would astonish
an European shopkeeper.</p>

<p>At the end of three years the landlord will have his land
in good working order,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the storekeeper will have most,
if not all, of the new colonist’s share of profits. The latter
can then, if he likes, have some more virgin land on similar
terms. He is a mere labourer, a worker for others, with no
betterment on his own horizon.</p>

<p>There is as yet no real practically working official
machinery by which he can obtain a direct grant of land in
freehold to himself; such as exists, with other added
facilities, in each of our own great agricultural dependencies
such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p>For this reason alone, the rural population of Argentina
has almost ceased to show much more than a vegetative
increase. The population of the whole Republic is that of
greater London spread over an area only a very little less
than that of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Denmark,
France, Holland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and
Switzerland put together.</p>

<p>This lack of increase in the rural population is not due to
Argentina being a country unknown to the appropriate
class of people. There are thousands of Italian peasants
who go there regularly every year as harvesters, and who
return to their own country as soon as the crops are gathered
in. They know Argentina and the natural richness of her
resources as well as do born Argentines, but they also know
that they cannot get land. Only wages; the purchasing
power of which is so much greater in Italy that there they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
can live on them in semi-idleness for the remainder of the
year, whereas they would attain no greater pecuniary
advantage by remaining and working permanently in
Argentina, where the cost of living is relatively very great.
So they remain “swallows” as they are called, coming and
going with the beginning and close of the harvest season.</p>

<p>If Argentina wants settlers, and she does need them
badly, she must make up her mind to give them land.</p>

<p>And she must also make a thorough overhaul of the titles
to all lands as yet not under cultivation. Because many of
such lands are merely traps for the unwary who may be
induced to occupy and develop them only to find himself,
after he has ploughed and planted, called upon to pay rent
to some resident in Buenos Aires or some other town whose
property they turn out to be, under some long-forgotten
Government grant, and who has not only never visited them,
but has also practically lain in wait for some innocent settler
to develop them under the impression that they were his own.
Cases of this kind have happened over and over again; and
the deluded settler, who may have even purchased the land
in question at a public auction or have obtained it from some
self-styled colonizing Company, finds himself with nothing
but a vista of wearisome and costly litigation before he can
hope to grasp a usually very elusive remedy for his wrong.
Generally, he gives the whole thing up in despair and becomes
a tenant of the land on which he has already spent all
his small capital. These things are also known to the Italian
harvester, and the knowledge of them acts as a further deterrent
to his becoming a settler.</p>

<p>As Argentina is blessed with almost the best possible laws
about everything sublunary, she has, naturally, first-rate
colonization regulations. Only these are confined to her
statute books and sundry pamphlets which lie in dust-covered
heaps in the Ministry of Agriculture. But there is
as yet no real working machinery for the carrying out in
practice of all these excellent embodiments of the results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of experience of farming colonization all the world over.
There are no officials whose exclusive duty it is to attend to
the multiple exigencies of true colonization, and none
capable of such work if they were suddenly called upon to
do it, for lack of the necessary experience.</p>

<p>An intending colonist may therefore land in Buenos Aires
with a small but sufficient amount of capital for a reasonable
start in, say, Australia or Canada, and may wander about
that city till, if he be foolish enough, his money is all spent
without ever having found any Government office or official
willing or in a position to put him into possession of the land
he wants.</p>

<p>He usually, after a few weeks of fruitless search, goes
back to Australia or New Zealand or wherever else he may
have come from, disgusted with Argentina and her ways;
of which he, on getting back, gives an account which
effectually damps off any existing enthusiasm in his neighbourhood
for emigration to the River Plate for a long while
to come.</p>

<p>The Argentine Government spends plenty of money in
advertisement, and true advertisement, of the fertility and
marvellous climates of a Republic which extends over 35
degrees of latitude, but neglects to make provision for those
who may desire to respond actively to its propaganda.
This neglect is due, really, to an inherent incapacity for
detail, part of the Argentine nature which, therefore, is
terribly prone to get tired half-way through a job. In South
America, generally, a wonderful amount of enthusiasm is
always available for the planning of new schemes. The
declamatory exposition of their sovereign virtues and glory
amid the acclamations of sympathetic Board or Committee
meetings is a grateful task; as is that of the dissemination
of these discourses in pamphlet form, in which also the full
list of the names of the originators and supporters of the
scheme appears. It is, however, when practice shows unworkable
flaws in splendid theories, when the drudgery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
adapting high-flown principles to plain everyday drab facts
must take the place of inaugural banquets and florid speeches,
that Argentine enthusiasm has a regrettable way of petering
out. Soon, something newer and of a different kind is started
by someone else. The meetings and banquets are held in its
honour by other groups and the former scheme passes to a
shadowy land, the way to which is always kept paved with
a plenitude of good intentions.</p>

<p>Capital will always be forthcoming for profitable enterprise;
as will Labour if that enterprise be made profitable
to the worker—a good and useful class of whom can only be
induced to emigrate by the prospect of permanent betterment
of the conditions of life. The natural ambition of
every man is to work for himself, to be the master of the
results of his own efforts and to possess those results as a
provision for his old age and his children. This a new
country or colony must offer if it would obtain the high
level of intelligent labour which it needs for its fullest and
best development.</p>

<p>On the other hand no one need starve or go hungry for
long in any of the countries of the River Plate; unless he
elects to be and to remain a persistent loafer in one of the
large towns. Even then he has only to ask and he will
receive food, at almost any restaurant or private house. If
he refuse to beg or to leave town, he may suffer hunger and
thirst, otherwise he cannot. To begin with he can always
get a job at one thing or another from any of the numerous
private agencies which have standing orders for labour, and
even schoolmasters, for the “Camp,” and which are as avid
of candidates for such jobs as any crimp of the old days was
for men of any kind to sling aboard a ship.</p>

<p>Once in the camp any man who has had the grit to go
there is sure of finding someone wanting some kind of
work which he can do in some sort of fashion. There he will
recover such of his normal health and strength as he may
have lost as a city unemployed, and will soon shake into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a capacity for, and get, something better to do than his first
job.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The native agricultural labourer or “peon” is a very free
and easy and light-hearted kind of person, and must be
treated accordingly if his services are to be retained. He is
never rude unless in answer to obviously intentional offence
offered to himself, and will work very much harder for an
employer he likes than for one he finds unsympathetic.
Indeed he will only remain with the latter on his own tacit
understanding that he takes things easily.</p>

<p>When he has accumulated a few dollars of wages he will
take himself off to the nearest store or township and indulge
in such dissipation as the place affords. From thence he
departs with perhaps a few cheap handkerchiefs or other
small finery, in the breast of his blouse, which he bestows
as gifts at various friendly cottages; at each of which he
may while away a day, partaking of pot luck, a shake down
on the floor, and innumerable mates and cigarettes, making
himself merrily agreeable to his hosts. When he gets tired
of this, or has exhausted the immediate circle of his friends,
he will return to work on the property on which he left off;
or somewhere else should he find himself not as well received
on his return as he had hoped.</p>

<p>It is pretty much all one to him. An experienced native
peon need never go far begging for a job.</p>

<p>These men are strong and wiry, capable of spurts of very
hard work indeed; so that, even with frequent intervals for
chat with everyone available, their average day’s work is
usually by no means a bad one. Severity in an employer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
they will take with perfect good humour; but any affected
superiority, or “side,” on his part will meet with a very
contemptuous resentment. They are true sons of a Republic,
though holding school-learning in the deep respect observable
in peasantry almost all the world over.</p>

<p>The Argentine peon inherits much of the ready wit and
extraordinary gift of repartee of his immediate ancestor
the <span class="smcapuc">GAUCHO</span>; of whom he is the modern representative. With
whom, however, a concertina has most unfortunately taken
the place of the guitar. But as a bachelor he is the same
flirtatious, lady-killing scamp; loving often and riding away
from, most frequently instead of with, the lady of his
ephemeral choice.</p>

<p>His wit, and hers, most frequently take the form of
double entente. An interchange of chaff has always one
perfectly innocent superficial meaning and another the
realization of which would redden the ears of a British
bargee. Both parties to this skilled contest of phrases
keep perfectly immobile countenances and neither gives a
sign, except by his or her, always latent, reply, of any
perception of the underlying significance of the conversation.</p>

<p>This exchange of wit is a form of art derived from the
gaucho <i lang="es">Payadores</i> or minstrels, who improvised their songs
in verses which, on the face of them, were hymns to Nature
in its purer forms, and contrived simultaneously to either
hugely amuse ribald company or else to convey insult to a
present rival payador who answered in like manner in his
turn; hidden insult being thus intentionally heaped on
insult till a fight with knives succeeded singing. A fight in
which all present took sides and joined.</p>

<p>Thus were Sundays enjoyed in the <span class="smcapuc">PULPERIAS</span> (canteens)
of the older times, over a quarter of a century ago.</p>

<p>A now almost lost art of those days was the knife play in
which the gaucho was then an extraordinary adept. Even
now gauchos may be found, in the distant northern Provinces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
who in a duel, according as it be a serious or a playful one,
can kill or just draw a pin-prick’s show of blood at will from
their adversary. In these duels the knife is kept in constant
rapid, dazzling movement, while the <i lang="es">poncho</i> or
gaucho shawl, with a slit through which the head is passed
when wearing, is wrapped round the left arm which is used
as a guard.</p>

<p>The gaucho was a picturesque figure in his <i lang="es">chiripá</i><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> or
festal, wide-bottomed, lace-frilled trousers, a broad leathern
girdle studded with silver coins and his silver-mounted, high-pommelled
saddle. The <i lang="es">chiripá</i> and girdle remain; and
one may still see a camp dandy glorious on feast-days in a
saddle adorned with silver mountings.</p>

<p>But the cow-boy utility of the gaucho waned with the
advent of scientific farming. He had no taste nor aptitude
for such new-fangled ideas; and now his sons are mostly
to be found in the army, the police, or that very useful body
of firemen and soldiers too, the corps of “Bomberos,” men
who can be relied on at any moment to quell a fire or a riot
in their own very effective way. They fear neither flames
nor turbulent strikers, and are only too ready, in the case of
the latter, to shoot first and listen to orders afterwards.
Another body of men drawn almost exclusively from gaucho
sources is the “Squadron of Security”; a mounted corps of
steel-cuirassed and helmeted semi-military police, also used
to clear the streets of political or other disturbances. Three
trumpet blasts sounded in quick succession are the signal for a
charge in lines extending, for instance, over the whole breadth
of the Avenida de Mayo. Such is the law and everyone, as in
England, is presumed to know it. If he do not, and therefore
fail to take prompt refuge down a side street or in a shop, so
much the worse for him. The Avenida will be cleared even if
he be taken to the Asistencia Publica as a consequence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
process, without any valid claim for damages. He heard the
“Clarion” and is assumed to have contumaciously disregarded
its warning.</p>

<p>It might be thought that the vegetative increase of such a
hardy nucleus of native population would suffice for the
Labour needs of the country. There are, however, many
reasons for the fact that it does not. The chief of these is
the general refractoriness of the Indian to the process of
education on the lines of the white races. You cannot by
any means make a white man out of an Indian any more
than you can of a Negro. And the gaucho has usually
more Indian (and Negro, from the slave days) blood in him
than he has white.</p>

<p>Unrivalled in the days when vast hordes of semi-savage cattle
needed rounding up and cutting out with his lazo and <i lang="es">boleadora</i>,
the gaucho has not always the patience nor the regard for
detail needed for the care of prize Durhams, Polled Angus or
Herefords; nor is he at his best with modern agricultural
machinery. Neither does his character lend itself to the dull
discipline expected and necessary on a farm to-day. He can
no longer with impunity stay the extra day or two at the
canteen to which his savings entitle him; and on the farm
he finds himself confined to the more subservient work.
Against all this his native pride rebels, and he gradually
drifts into the army or the police, where he is gradually
being exterminated by the disintegrating effects of idleness
and lack of the hard physical exercise which kept his
ancestors in health. A greedy meat-eater, he succumbs as
often to stomach as to lung trouble.</p>

<p>Population! In every other way nature is most bountiful
on the River Plate. If only Argentina were more thickly
peopled her wealth would be phenomenal in the world. For
it must not be thought that grain and cattle sum up the
whole extent of her possible productivity. Far from it: her
output has hitherto been confined to these commodities
because they were so obviously those which most readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
yield immediate profits, without in the first place demanding
any great outlay of capital or scientific acquirements. Cattle
there have always been on the Pampa since the time of the
Goes’ cows;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and as for grain, the virgin soil barely needed
scratching for its growth. Thus cereal cultivation and cattle
raising naturally became the national industries, and the
population has never been sufficient to attend even to
all the possibilities of these, let alone others. Nevertheless,
there are many more which Nature has in store
for these marvellous countries with their great variety
of climates.</p>

<p>Sugar (pretty badly exploited till recently), coffee, cotton,
tobacco (already grown in the North and even, to a comparatively
small extent, in the Province of Buenos Aires) and
timber of many and valuable kinds are among the future
produce of the Southern Republics; while the wool output
of Argentina could be greatly increased.</p>

<p>No lack of capital would be felt were there the necessary
skilled management and labour available for the production
of, leaving sugar and timber apart for the moment, let us say
cotton and tobacco.</p>

<p>In the cultivation of both of these, much depends on
selection of kinds according to soil and climate and on the
right moment for gathering. It is owing to ignorance in
these regards as well as to labour difficulties that several
attempts to cultivate these crops on a large scale have
hitherto only resulted in failure.</p>

<p>Given the necessary science and labour, soil and
climate may well be trusted to do the rest for assured
success.</p>

<p>Nothing is lacking to the countries of the River Plate but
population. Given adequate human agency to exploit their
evident and latent treasures, they have before them a future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
prosperity which can only be called <em>incalculable</em> in its
marvellous immensity.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—A fact that cannot escape observation by the reader of this
book is that of the comparative absence of exact statistical information
disclosed in it in regard to Uruguay in comparison with that which appears
relating to Argentina. The reason of this is that while the latter country
has now had many decades in which to put its house in order, the former
is still so busily occupied in that necessary task that its officials have as
yet had little time to devote to compiling authoritative statistics of a
progress of which it must not, therefore, be inferred that they and their
country are not very justly proud.</p>

<p>Thus figures which are easily available through the patriotic ability
and industry of Dr. Francisco Latzina, the chief of the National Argentine
Statistical Department, and so clearly and strikingly digested by Señor
Ricardo Pillado, the Director of the Division of Commerce and Industry
in the Argentine Ministry of Agriculture, a Ministry the scope of whose
work is extremely wide and all-important in the Republic, have really
yet no counterparts in Uruguay, where one is rather left to guess at the
general effect of such isolated agricultural trade statistics as alone are
immediately available. Figures are to be had by the private courtesy
of individuals connected with various administrations, and these, if not
exact, are no doubt approximately so; but they do not bear the stamp
nor the proof of comparison which should be found in authoritative
figures.</p>

<p>The author knows from the test of his own previous experience
that such few figures as he has given concerning Uruguay are substantially
correct, and must therefore, though reluctantly, ask the reader to take
his word for it that they are so.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WAR<br />
ITS PRESENT AND PROBABLE FUTURE EFFECTS ON
ARGENTINA AND URUGUAY</span></h2>

<p>As has been indicated elsewhere in these pages, the
shock of the commencement of the Great War
found the River Plate Republics already in a
condition of considerable local depression. This was owing
to relatively poor harvests, due to a long continuance of
exceptional and ill-timed rains; a consequent collapse of
land speculation and the usually sinister effects of slump
after a long period of boom; and the condition of money
markets, for some time past disturbed by the fear of the
results of political complications in the Balkans.</p>

<p>The Governments of Argentina and Uruguay must be
most warmly congratulated on the vigour and promptitude
with which they faced the fact that, with the declaration of
war in Europe, they were suddenly left to their own resources
to an extent they had never experienced during the
few decades which really form the whole period of their true
economic history.</p>

<p>Lucky it was for Argentina that such a veteran statesman
as Dr. Victorino de la Plaza occupied the Presidential chair,
and that he had the aid of a man of such high intelligence
and reputation as Dr. Carbó as Minister of Finance; fortunate
also for Uruguay in having Dr. Viera (since elected
President) at the head of her Ministry of Finance.</p>

<p>Honour is also due to the Officials of the State Banks of
both nations and to the private Banks and financiers who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
lent such an untiring and efficacious aid to both Governments
in the hour of pardonable alarm; alarm which was
prevented from developing into panic by the prompt and
statesmanlike measures adopted.</p>

<p>Really, as Mr. C. A. Tornquist justly observes in an article
cited in these pages, it cannot be said that a “crisis”
exists in a country while its vital forces are in full development.</p>

<p>Still, in Argentina and Uruguay these forces had not for
some time been in full operation, from causes stated above;
and, therefore, panic would not have been a surprising result
from alarm falling on depression, before cool reason had time
to assert its reassuring influence.</p>

<p>It soon did so, however, thanks to the virile and sound
handling of the situation by the heads of Government and
Finance.</p>

<p>Congresses assembled and their usually heterogeneous
political elements unanimously and swiftly agreed to pass
the several measures of economic defence placed before
them.</p>

<p>During seven days’ Bank Holiday the finance of both
Republics was set in good order; not only to avoid ill
consequences from the initial and any likely future shocks,
but to enable the countries to profit—as there can now be
little doubt they are doing and will do—from the political
and economic disturbance of Europe.</p>

<p>As Señor Carlos F. Soares, writing in <cite>La Nacion</cite> (Buenos
Aires) under date January 1st, 1915, said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The laws and financial and economic measures necessitated
by the European conflagration have proved opportune and
efficacious.</p>

<p>Thanks to them, danger to the Credit Houses and Institutions
was avoided; Internal and Foreign commercial pressure was
lessened, the gold stock in the “Caja de Conversión,” which
guarantees the value of the paper currency, was preserved;
the escape of gold from the country was avoided; the lack of
foreign bills of exchange was compensated for by deposits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
gold at the various Argentine Legations; shortage of coal and
dearness of wheat and flour were foreseen; and, finally, means
of obtaining its value were assured to the natural wealth of the
country.</p>

</div>

<p>Only one Buenos Aires Bank (of comparatively small importance)
failed to reopen its doors after the seven days’
holiday; a failure which there is some reason to believe
was by no means entirely due to the War.</p>

<p>Not one Bank and very few Commercial Houses availed
themselves of the Moratorium; a fact which is highly
creditable to the Local Banking and Commercial community.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the deposits of gold at the Legations
constitute a feature novel to the system of International
Exchange.</p>

<p>After all this accomplished in so short a space of time, who
will continue to throw the reproach of “Mañana” at either
Argentines or Uruguayans? A reproach long since unjustified
by the attitude of the inhabitants of either of the River
Plate Republics towards any matter the advantages of which
they grasp.</p>

<p>No European Statesmen and Bankers could have more
promptly realized and carried out the necessary measures
for the economic protection of their country.</p>

<p>The present of Argentina and Uruguay was thus assured.
What of their future?</p>

<p>Prophecy, which is generally counted as hazardous,
is especially so when it is about to be printed, and may
still be read by the light of the experience of several years
hence. Still, some Commercial and Financial angels have
not feared to tread the ground of prophecy as to the immediate
and <i lang="la">post-bellum</i> future of Argentina and Uruguay;
and not only has competent authority not feared to forecast
results in this regard, but there is a remarkable unanimity
of influential opinion as to the probably favourable effects
of European affairs on the economy of the River Plate
Republic. Always supposing, as there seems every reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to suppose, that these Republics continue to have the
commercial and common sense to manage their internal
affairs in such manner as to be able to derive the greatest
possible pecuniary benefits from the troubles of European
nations.</p>

<p>One, perhaps the chief, in his courage of declaration of
these prophetic authorities is Mr. C. A. Tornquist; a man
having very large financial and commercial interests on the
River Plate and enjoying a very high local reputation for
business acumen and honour. His whole life has been spent
in the higher financial circles of Argentina.</p>

<p>Therefore the author has thought well to cite here some
portions of an article published by him in the Argentine
Press, a translation of which appeared in <cite>The Review of the
River Plate</cite>, under date December 25th, 1914.</p>

<p>In this article Mr. Tornquist says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>From this chaos (that of the European War) there will arise
perhaps an Asiatic country, and, quite certainly, some American
countries, and in the first place the Argentine Republic, which,
on account of the class and special conditions of its products, is
called upon to benefit from the situation more than any other
country in the world, as even the United States cannot export
in any quantity the noble products produced by Argentina as
they require them for home consumption. This war not only
does not create difficulties for our economic development, as
will happen to nearly all the other countries in the world, but,
on the contrary, it will stimulate it, and for this reason, the longer
the war lasts the more our national economy will gain at the
expense, sad as it is to say it, of the countries now at war. Whilst
the war lasts the prices of the majority of our products will not
decline, for many of the countries which produce the same goods
as we do are at war, and on this account the demand is bound
to increase. The first effects of this advantageous situation
will bring about the disappearance of what we call here “crisis,”
but which is nothing more than a “commercial indigestion,”
brought about by excessive speculation, and which has principally
affected speculators, and has done absolutely no harm
to pastoral or agricultural industries, which are our principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
sources of wealth. … It cannot be said that a country is in
“crisis” when its vital forces are in full development. This
does not mean, nevertheless, what many erroneously think, that
if the next crop is good they will be able in 1915 to sell their
lands in the vicinity of cities and summer resorts and speculative
regions at the prices ruling when they purchased them. Nothing
of this will occur, and only the value of revenue-producing
property will normalize itself, and will be placed at a value
corresponding to a return of 8 to 9 per cent per annum. On the
other hand, I believe that several, perhaps many, years will
pass before it will be possible to liquidate properties which do
not give revenue at the prices which their owners desire. …
A favourable factor which might become important, perhaps in
the not distant future, is the immigration of the “capitalist”
farmer from Belgium and other European countries, who prefer
to liquidate their affairs there and come to Argentina with what
remains to them, and so get away from the taxes which of
necessity the Government of the conquering or conquered
countries must impose so as to re-establish their finances. It
is a very interesting fact for ourselves that after all large wars
or revolutions in Europe in modern times there has been an
enormous increase of good immigration in new countries, and
especially to America, from which the United States has been the
first to benefit, because in that epoch the future of South America
was based solely on the gold mines of Peru and the coffee and
diamonds of Brazil, whilst the Argentine Republic was only
known by its “sterile Pampa and Patagonia,” and its internal
revolutions. To-day these things have changed, and if any
country is to interest the capitalist immigrant it will without
doubt in the first place be the Argentine Republic, because it is in
the best condition to receive them, especially if they are convinced
that the value of property is not inflated. It is the duty of
our Government to make all this known to future immigrants
by means of serious propaganda. … Then we shall have to
struggle against the lack of tonnage for exporting our crop, but
we should not forget that whereas to export with regularity is
for us an economic question, for the belligerent countries, purchasers
of our produce, the matter is of vital importance, as it is
a material question not to die of hunger, and of indispensable
necessity to be able to carry on the war, so that those countries
are even more interested than ourselves that we should be able
to dispose of the necessary means of transport. We take as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
our basis of the probable assets of our balance of payments an
exportation to the value of $580,000,000 gold. At first sight
this figure appears high, but let us analyse it. Our record of
exports was in 1912-13 $513,500,000 gold, of which $306,000,000
corresponded to cereals and the remainder to produce not affected
by locusts, droughts, rain or frost, that is to say, the crop of that
year represented $306,000,000 gold for produce exported, and
we will suppose $104,000,000 remained in the country, making
a total of $410,000,000. If the crop of this year should be 25 per
cent less than our “record” crop we should have “at the prices
of that time” $307,000,000 as the value of the harvest, and
there would remain, deducting what the country requires for
consumption and seed, over $200,000,000 for export. But the
actual prices and those in perspective are 25 per cent higher
than the others, so that would give $250,000,000 for exports
of cereals, besides which there are the other products (meat,
wool, hides, tallow, etc.), which then represented a value of
$207,000,000 gold, and which to-day are worth 20 per cent more,
that is to say, $250,000,000 gold, making a total of $500,000,000
gold. To this we must add the value of 2,500,000 tons of maize,
the balance of last year’s crop which remained to be exported
on October 1st, 1914; the possible value of the export of horses;
the value of the sugar exported, which is more than 60,000 tons,
and which will probably be duplicated; the export of woven
goods (ponchos, cloths, etc.) and articles of saddlery and tanned
goods for the European governments; alcohol and other products
of lesser importance, which come under the heading of
extraordinary exports. It would not therefore be at all extraordinary
if we reached $600,000,000 or even passed that figure,
which will be the case if our harvest exceeds our estimate. …
If the crop turned out to be a “bad” one<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> (that is to say, that
it failed in certain parts, as due to the great extension of area,
it is not possible to-day for a whole crop to be lost) and it only
results in 50 per cent of that of 1912-13, we should still obtain
a total value of $205,000,000, and there would remain after
deducting the necessities for home requirements $100,000,000
gold for export, calculated on prices of two years ago, but in
this case the prices would rise much more than 25 per cent, and
for this reason the consumption of cereals in the country, as well
as imports in general, would show such a marked decrease, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the favourable superavit in the balance of payments would
never completely disappear.</p>

<p>I take as my starting-point the sum of $460,000,000 gold,
made up as follows:—<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Imports $270,000,000 gold.
(<i>b</i>) Service of the Public Debt payable abroad $50,000,000
gold.
(<i>c</i>) Interest on Cedulas and on capital placed by foreign
companies on mortgage $31,000,000 gold.
(<i>d</i>) Interest and dividends on foreign capital in railways
$42,000,000 gold.
(<i>e</i>) Interest and dividends on other foreign capital
$27,000,000 gold.
(<i>f</i>) Savings of immigrants and emigrants $24,000,000 gold.
(<i>g</i>) Expenses of Argentines abroad $6,000,000 gold.</p>

<p>The sum total of all these items is $460,000,000 gold, so that
we have</p>

<p class="noindent">in favour of the Argentine Republic, a sum which can be increased
if the harvest is very good and imports are less than I estimated,
and decreased if the harvest is bad and imports greater than
$246,000,000 gold. From this it will be seen that if my calculations
are confirmed Argentina will receive from abroad the sum
of $120,000,000 gold for balance of accounts for the commercial
year of 1914-15. To demonstrate the importance of this fact
I will mention that for the year 1913-14 the balance was
$185,000,000 against Argentina; in 1912-13 it was $200,000,000
in contra, and in 1911-12 $202,000,000 in contra, so that compared
with the three previous years Argentina will have a difference
in its favour in the balance of payments of $300,000,000 gold!</p>

<p>What do these figures signify?</p>

<p>$120,000,000 gold is equivalent to the service of the National
Debt for two and a half years, and is more than half the amount
actually deposited in bullion in the Caja de Conversión. It also
represents the half of all that the country owes abroad for mortgages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
On the other hand, $300,000,000 are three-fourths of
all our national external debt, are two annual national budgets,
as well as the total value of a good harvest. Practically speaking,
it results that the Argentine Republic will receive with these
$120,000,000 gold a sum which exceeds the average of the new
foreign capital which has come to the country in the last few
years, which will compensate for the absence of capital which
formerly came to the country seeking investment, and will
contribute to develop the economic forces of the country.
Outside of this $120,000,000 gold it is logical to imagine that
some capital will come, as some railways and other foreign
companies have recently made issues abroad and others will
place their profits here. There are also the various financial
operations of the National and Provincial Governments and the
Municipality of the capital for the payment of debt services or
to consolidate the floating debt, for although money does not
come to the country this will diminish by these operations the
emigration of capital in respect of items <i>b</i>, <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> of the
balance of payments, that is to say, the dividends and interest
on foreign capital placed in commercial enterprises and railways,
and thus also the service of the external debt, which otherwise
would have to be remitted and all of which I have not taken into
account. Besides, where will Europeans place their savings?
In European bonds which continue to depreciate on account of
the issue which will have to be made for the war debt and to
consolidate the monetary situation? Assuredly more money
will come here than many believe in search of investment. The
United States with its new monetary law does not require as
much as before. To Brazil and Chile it will not go for some time,
neither to Mexico or the Balkans.</p>

<p>An interesting point is the manner in which these $120,000,000
will come into the country.</p>

<p>It should come in the form of Argentine bonds (“Cedulas”
principally), and in coined gold all that is not employed to cover
debts payable to our commerce and industry to European banks
and manufacturers, which sums cannot be very considerable,
although it is difficult to fix them. … The reaction will bring
about the investment of savings in Argentine revenue-producing
bonds instead of in purchases of land on monthly payments;
it will bring about a reduction in interest and as a consequence
of this an abundance of money which will stubbornly withstand
speculation in land. The movement of the Stock Exchange will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
reawaken—it has been dead since 1906—and there will be money
for mortgages and business, replacing that which came from
abroad and which has to be repaid. All of this will bring in time
an immigration of Cedulas of our external debt bonds and of
railway and industrial shares. What will probably not take
place for several years, perhaps for many, is what I mentioned
at the commencement, namely, that land and other objects of
speculation which do not produce anything will rise to prices
which their owners dream about and pretend to obtain, as
neither banks nor capitalists will invest their money in such
objects, neither will they stimulate speculation, all of which are
circumstances which will contribute to develop the economic
forces of the country and to foment its industries and its commerce
until there arrives for the Argentine Republic the psychological
moment of being able to produce all that it consumes,
that is to say, become self-supporting, without having to fall
back on European industry, a situation at which the United
States of North America have arrived after great efforts.</p>

</div>

<p>Remains only to be added that Mr. Tornquist appears to
have omitted consideration of the possibility of money
being <em>withdrawn</em> from South America by European investors,
not on account of any lack of confidence, but simply because
such investors may under existing conditions have actual
need of all the pecuniary resources they are able to realize.</p>

<p>For the getting in of the 1914-15 harvests there
has been sufficient labour available; because of the
stoppage of much municipal and building work, on account
of retrenchment rendered necessary by the situation. But
for the future, if, indeed, they are to occupy the prominent
place in the world’s economy for which Nature appears to
have destined them, the River Plate Republics will have to
increase their agricultural populations greatly and speedily.</p>

<p>The need of this is now fully realized in both countries,
but, strange to say, it is in Uruguay where there are no
fiscal lands that proposals for probably useful legislation to
this end have attained the greater maturity. It is there
proposed, in effect, that the Government should purchase,
at least portions of, the present holdings of the large landowners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and colonize the land so purchased on systems
similar to that obtaining in, for instance, Canada.</p>

<p>Argentina still has large tracts of fiscal land, but no doubt
her large landowners will also aid towards the colonization
by granting to colonists greater fixity of tenure and greater
facilities for mixed farming than the latter have been
hitherto able to obtain.</p>

<p>With regard to Belgian emigration to the River Plate, the
fact which cannot be lost sight of is that the Belgian, especially
the Fleming, is a person deeply attached to his own land and
his own ways of living. It seems certain that if Belgians of the
agricultural class are to be colonized in South America, such
colonization will have to be effected by means of settlements
like those of the Welsh colony in Chubut and the Swiss
colony in Colonia.</p>

<p>A Flemish family would view with vehement disgust the
ramshackle home of an Argentine or Uruguayan <span class="smcapuc">CHACRERO</span>
(small farmer); a disgust which, communicated to their friends
in Europe, would effectually stop further Belgian immigration.</p>

<p>The Belgian is a good worker, but he is much more
“insular” than the British in his scorn of ways of living
which differ from his own. He is not adaptable enough, in
any way, to be put to live or work among the composite
Spanish-Italian-American rural classes of the River Plate.</p>

<p>Probably both Argentine and Uruguayan will continue to
work out his own salvation in this vital matter of attracting
agricultural colonists to his land. Already the spirit of
democratic unrest menaces privilege in Argentina, privilege
which has already been destroyed in Uruguay. And the
greatest political danger which now seems to threaten
Argentina and has for some time past been the bane of
Uruguay is doctrinairism; a tendency to pursue to most
unpractically illogical consequences theories which seem to
their initiators and supporters to be destined to cure all the
social and economic ills to which man is prone.</p>

<p>State socialism from high places in Uruguay and socialism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of all kinds and varieties from lower social spheres in Argentina
are each set on the adoption of its own empiric policy.</p>

<p>Like all young things, these Republics must pick themselves
up again when they fall (and, in truth, they display
great capability for doing so), but it would be well if, just at
the present moment, they were to adopt and fully carry out
some provedly sound colonizing policy. Afterwards they
might experiment with single-tax, rural Banks, state ownership
of land and all upon and within it, as much as they
might find themselves able to afford to do.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they must work patiently, in unadventurous
fashion, towards the most soundly rapid possible development
of their rich natural resources.</p>

<p>During 1915, all extension of activity was at a standstill
in both Republics. Little or no land changed hands,
unless under practically forced sale; city improvements
and private building projects were stayed, and no new railway
extensions were put under construction.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>A few good harvests<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> will put these things as they were;
but the lesson of the War will have been lost for Argentina
and Uruguay if they do not see to the matter of the extension
of their agricultural industries.</p>

<p>It seems, however, that they now are solidly determined
to do so; and that, far from the lesson of recent events being
lost for them, the finding of themselves cast on their own
resources has led to a most beneficial and self-sacrificing
examination of what those resources are in contrast with
what they so easily might be.</p>

<p>The real vitality of these countries can be measured by the
fact that the prices of their National Securities, which fell
with the world-wide shock of July-August, 1914, were by
the following September already on the high road to the
practically complete recovery they have now attained.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">HISTORY AND POLITICS</span></h2>

<p>The political history of the River Plate Republics
begins with the wars which made possible the great
Declaration of Independence from the dominion of
Spain on the 25th of May, 1810. Their most romantic
history is that of those wars and that of the old Colonial
days immediately preceding them. As, however, the only
slight pretension of the present book is to be informative
on matters of fact, romance must wait on, perchance, the
author’s more leisured moments and some outline be presented
now of the events which had most influence in
making Argentina and Uruguay what they are to-day.</p>

<p>Having overthrown the rule of Spain the former River
Plate colonies became involved in a long internecine struggle
for supremacy of power. For fifty years the United States
of the River Plate were most disunited by local jealousies
and the rural districts were only usually unanimous in their
refusal to submit to the Government at Buenos Aires, composed
of men who, as the rural populations said with a great
amount of truth, were endeavouring to rule even more
despotically than did the Viceroys and by purely Viceregal
methods. Were that submitted to, the revolution would
have been in vain as far as concerned the substitution of
democratic principles for those of tyranny. This was no
doubt true, for the politicians of Buenos Aires neither knew,
nor had had any opportunity of knowing, methods of
Government other than those under which they themselves
had been brought up. Had they known it, though it is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
just to them to say that they did not in the least realize
the fact, rule under them in the way they proposed to rule,
would have been merely an exchange of King Stork for King
Log. The country was, however, quick to grasp the menace,
and it is only very regrettable that rivalry between its
several contemporary would-be saviours produced so long
a continuance of political chaos, during which newly acquired
Liberty and Independence had no chance to develop
the vast natural resources which had lain idle in consequence
of the Spanish policy of squeezing the life out of the goose
which would otherwise have laid so many golden eggs for
Spain. In consequence of civil war it was, as has been indicated,
not much before 1860 that it began to lay any
appreciable number of such eggs for itself or anyone else.
It only began to do so under two tyrants: Rozas in the
South and Artígas in the North. Both were strong men
and patriots; and both held power, in spite of opposition
both open and treacherous, for, as later history has shown,
the good of the respective territories they had brought
under their sway. Harsh as were their methods, these were
suited to lawless times. Of each of them it has been said
that he permitted no thief but himself to live.</p>

<p>As a fact neither were thieves nor sought nor attained
overmuch wealth for themselves. Both, however, forestalled
otherwise inevitable assassination by giving their enemies
no shrift at all; once these had been ascertained. And both
succeeded in establishing police systems throughout their
territories which would rival the European secret services
of to-day.</p>

<p>Nothing went on unknown to them; from short-lived
conspiracies to petty thefts. And the punishment for each
offence inflicted by them was swift and closely fitted to the
crime.</p>

<p>No one has yet attempted a complete whitewashing of
Rozas; though, in every political crisis in which the Government
has shown any apparent weakness, old men have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
sighed for his reincarnation. Artígas, on the other hand,
whose memory not so long ago rivalled those of the most
traditionally cruel old-world potentates, is now become the
Saviour and National hero of Uruguay. The apostle of the
democratic principle.</p>

<p>Truth about his personality probably lies somewhere
between these two views, but there is no doubt but that he
and Rozas were men needed for and suited to their times.
Fearless and far-sighted, they made order out of chaos, and
individually cruel as may have been many of their acts, it
was their iron rule which laid the foundations of the admirable
constitutions of what are now the separate Republics
of Argentina and Uruguay. Rozas really founded the
Argentine Republic as much as Artígas did the “Banda
Oriental,” part of which is now Uruguay. But the period
of strife which succeeded the Declaration of the Independence
of the whole of the River Plate Territories had lasted just
over half a century when General Mitre was chosen as the
first President of a United Federal Argentina.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by Sarmiento, who did much to develop
agriculture and was the great pioneer of education. Sarmiento
had been a political exile in Europe, where he learned
much; and, being a man of exceptional intellect, stored up
his acquired knowledge and enlightenment for his country’s
subsequent great good.</p>

<p>Since the first Presidency of General Mitre there has only
been one political revolution which affected the whole of
Argentina, the one which in 1890 ousted President Juarez
Celman and was immediately succeeded by the financial
crisis with which the name of Baring is chiefly associated in
the European mind.</p>

<p>Both that revolution and the crisis were the natural outcome
of a disease which would have completely ruined any
country less rich in natural resources than Argentina. That
disease was complete political and financial corruption;
which then came to a head and necessitated drastic operation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Since then the Argentine nation has advanced in political
and financial health with extraordinary and unparalleled
rapidity.</p>

<p>The history of Uruguay has run on different lines since
she emerged from the older Banda Oriental. She has been
the almost constant victim, until very recent years, of the
fervent patriotism of her rural population; in rebellion,
often with much apparent justice, against what it has from
time to time considered to be the prejudicial doctrinarianism
of the town-bred men who have directed her Government in
Montevideo. In any case the rural population has always
been in a more or less declared state of rebellion against
the Government. For many years the “White” party
was in power and the “Red” in revolution. Now for
a long period the “Reds” have kept place and nominal
power, from which until comparatively very recently the
“Whites” have never ceased to endeavour to oust them.</p>

<p>Let it not, however, be thought that either the retention
of power by one party or its attempted overthrow by the
other has in Uruguay been due to personal ambition or
corrupt greed on either side; as has been, unfortunately but
very frequently, the case in other South American Republics.
To think this would be to do a cruel injustice to the national
character, the leading characteristics of which are uprightness
and honesty in thought or deed. No Uruguayan would
ever have rebelled had he not thought that the policy of the
existing Government was gravely prejudicial to the vital
interests of his country, nor would an Uruguayan statesman
have ever clung to power unless he had been conscientiously
convinced that the policy of his party was the only true
way to that country’s best development and prosperity.</p>

<p>This may seem to many readers as yet but little acquainted
with Uruguayan political and commercial History as the
mere expression of an enthusiasm for the Uruguayan character
on the part of the present writer. But a closer examination
of that History than is within the scope of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
work will show the views just above expressed to be nothing
more than a statement of cold fact. In part proof of which
stands the total absence from Uruguayan Financial History
of any repudiation or avoidance of the National indebtedness.
Long periods of Agricultural paralysis, often almost total
(in a land which depends exclusively on agricultural products),
due to civil strife and all the heavy outlay consequent
on such wars, have never led Uruguay to depart from the
strictly gold basis of her monetary system. Her paper dollar
has always retained its full face value as a token and remains
the best dollar on the exchange markets of the world. And
the world-wide credit of private Uruguayan firms stands high
above that of similar firms in other, even the most prosperous
South American Republics. This is due, and due only, to
the very high standard of political and commercial morality
obtaining, and which has always obtained, in Uruguay.</p>

<p>Now, there is good ground for the hope that the country
is persuaded that the best way to attain the greatest possible
general prosperity is to beat the sword, once and for ever,
into a ploughshare. At the same time it cannot be hidden
that “State Socialism gone mad” (to quote an Uruguayan
description of the policy introduced and pursued by Señor
Batlle y Ordoñez<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>) strained the patience of the rural population
and that of a goodly proportion of Montevideans as
well, to a degree which was perilously near to breaking point.
He wished, not only to improve all conditions of his country,
but to make Uruguay an object-lesson in State Socialism to
the world. His political enemies, or rather opponents, say
that, while he has read the works of Henry George, in some
confused translation or other, neither his education nor his
acquaintance with such subjects fits him to judge of even the
works of a now somewhat discredited political economist;
also that he, the ex-President, is a potentially dangerous
lunatic. But note that no one, even those who feared most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
from his persistent political and financial adventures, have
ever even so much as hinted that his policy was dictated by
other than quite honestly intentioned conviction. Uruguayans
are seldom corrupt and seldom suspect venality in
their fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>Modern Argentina history commences with the renaissance
of the country immediately after the upheaval of 1891, and
that of Uruguay a much less number of years ago. Till these
periods, political unrest was a constant factor in both countries.
Now, a National revolution has become a thing unthinkable
in Argentina; while it grows every day less likely
for responsible or influential men in Uruguay to instigate or
encourage aught that might impede her triumphal march to
rivalry with the prosperity of the great sister Republic on
the Southern bank of the River Plate.</p>

<p>The recent death of Dr. Saenz Peña, an Argentine President
whose high personal character and statesmanlike rule
fully entitled him to the respect he received from all parties
and classes throughout the Republic, is a serious loss to his
country. Fortunately, however, the Presidential office is
now held by Dr. Victorino de la Plaza, formerly Vice-President,
a man of acknowledged soundness of judgment
and tact and of very many years’ experience in Ministerial,
Diplomatic and Parliamentary life.</p>

<p>As for Uruguay, her chief reliance must be on the deep
patriotism of her leading men and on their good sense to
keep a peace which is the only true road to the general
prosperity of a country the rich natural endowments of
which cannot develop if men and horses are taken from the
plough, as they constantly were in the past by one party
or the other, to partake in the mutual destruction of civil
war.</p>

<p>As is insisted on very often in these pages, the chief
need of these new countries is population; an end most
surely defeated by conditions which not only repelled all
immigration but killed off a large proportion of the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
already there. There is good reason to believe that all this
and more is now fully appreciated by every responsible man
in Uruguay; and, once convinced of the right course to be
followed for the country’s good, there is not a Uruguayan
who will not follow it with all the patriotic doggedness
which formerly caused the lamentable continuance of civil
war.</p>

<p>Both Argentine and Uruguayan financial policies and
methods are now sound. Argentina is prosperous with
great future increase of prosperity before her, and Uruguay
is now well on the high road to similar prosperity and as
brilliant a future. Both are at peace with one another and
their neighbouring Republics; all of whom are much too
busy with their own interests and too democratic in spirit
to dream of aggressive war. Added to which only Uruguay
and Paraguay are small enough to need ever to covet further
territory.</p>

<p>Brazil does not: Argentina has more than once already
in the past refused to take Uruguay into her Federation:
Paraguay, except as a constant nuisance to herself and
everyone near her, is, and will be for many years to come, a
negligible quantity in South American politics. The Andine
frontier now fixed between Chile and Argentine is never
again likely to be disturbed by either. Uruguay may
possibly cast longing eyes one day at the rich grazing lands
of Southern Brazil; but she is more than unlikely ever to
attempt to acquire these by force. Their annexation by her
could only occur on the initiative of the inhabitants of those
regions; who, unless Brazil is able in the future to keep her
financial and fiscal house in better order than at present,
might very conceivably prefer to be under the Government
of Montevideo rather than that of Rio de Janeiro. Even then,
the question of different languages would present a difficulty
to the assimilation of the State of Rio Grande del Sul by its
Southern neighbour.</p>

<p>One great step in the democratic progress of the Argentine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Republic was made three years ago on the initiative of Dr.
Roque Saenz Peña. This was the passing of a law which
introduced the ballot and made the exercise of the franchise
obligatory on a universal male suffrage of native-born
Argentines and foreigners of two years’ residence.</p>

<p>It was a great reform made necessary by many considerations.
The chief of which were the public indifference to all
matters political which did not immediately concern Industry
or Commerce and the profound discredit into which
elections, parliamentary and municipal, had fallen as a
consequence of that indifference; the whole effect of
which was to leave the internal government of the
country entirely in the hands of a mostly mercenary caste
of professional politicians. This caste was habitually
guilty of electoral corruption and malpractices which, in the
absence of any interested public opinion, continued to work
in a vicious circle by causing complete abstention from any
exercise of the vote on the part of all citizens of the Republic
except those forming the small gangs which were under the
orders of the “Caudillo” or political manager of each
district. These gangs went to the poll, at so much per head
in cash and many illicit privileges, in order that there
should be any voting at all to declare the due re-election of
the men who wielded the political power in the National or
Provincial Legislatures or in the Councils of the various
Municipalities.</p>

<p>The substitution, under the new Law, of genuine for
fictitious elections has also operated as another, and, probably,
final blow struck at the Provincial Oligarchies, reference
to which has been made in another chapter.</p>

<p>No one outside South America would really credit the
depths of corrupt absurdity in which elections in Argentina
were permitted to remain so late in these days of her general
enlightenment and prosperity. That reform in this highly
important respect was so long a-coming was due to individual
preoccupation with their own affairs of the people of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
country the material development of which was being
accomplished with bewildering rapidity.</p>

<p>Men had no time to occupy themselves with such a tough,
and rather dangerous, job as the dethronement of the professional
politician; who, in the higher spheres of Provincial
Government, usually belonged to one of the widely
influential groups of the historically dominant native
families. Public morality had sunk to a strangely low level
in comparison with the ever-increasing commercial rectitude
of the country, when the most startling tale of electoral
fraud or administrative corruption would be received with
only a shrug of the shoulders and an indulgent smile, as of
wonder why the narrator was making so much ado about
such a very ordinary occurrence.</p>

<p>The management of elections in the Federal Capital and
in the Provinces differed only in method; the results were
uniform triumphs for the party in power. In the Capital
the authorities went to the trouble of collecting the certificates
of citizenship (the deposit of which at the polling
booths was the form of voting under the old system) of dead
and absent men and sometimes of hiring others, and with
filling in blank forms of these with fictitious names, in
sufficient quantities to swamp any attempted voting by an
opposition. In the Provinces, the elections were always
stage-managed by the district commissary of Police. He
led up the necessary gang of peon voters, to whom he served
out a dinner of <i lang="es">carne con cuero</i>, wine and a $5 bill each,
to celebrate the occasion and to indemnify them for any
trouble they might have been put to by their attendance.
Furthermore, the faithful electors knew that in the case of
their getting into any scrape in the future which might
otherwise cause trouble between themselves and the police,
they would stand every possible chance of dismissal with a
friendly caution; while were the case one of assaulting an
enemy that enemy would stand a better chance of imprisonment
than they. These are not traveller’s tales, but facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
well known to every resident in Argentina and, I suspect,
similar facts are within the experience of everyone living in
one or other of most of the Latin American Republics. So
that the quantity of ink spilt in the European papers over
the accusations brought against ex-President Huerta, to
the effect that he had improperly influenced the late Mexican
Presidential Election, reads comically to most South
Americans.</p>

<p>Now, in Argentina, all qualified persons must vote, or be
mulcted in a penalty for not so doing. And it must be your
own fault if anyone else knows which way you have voted.
Even the innate native conviction that elections are rites
instituted for the exclusive benefit of the already elect must
have suffered severe shock from Dr. Saenz Peña’s Law. It
will now be difficult to obtain a price for a mere promise the
fulfilment or otherwise of which cannot be ascertained by
the purchaser.</p>

<p>The passing of the new Law really seems a miracle when
its interference with long-established custom is considered.
It has perhaps crowned the patrician caste with the glory of
heroically complete self-sacrifice. Certainly it heralds the
twilight of the gods who have guided the country’s destinies
since their ancestors led its rough armies to victory under
the autumnal sun of May, 1810 (the sun which is blazoned
in gold on the blue and white of the National banner), who
fought for or opposed Rozas and Artígas and upheld the
National prestige in the wearisome conflict with Paraguay.</p>

<p>In the old days of musket or rifle and bandolier, the
Argentine patricians freely gave their lives and fortunes for
the <span class="smcapuc">PATRIA</span>. Now in frock-coats and silk hats, they have
given up for her the right to all power not derived from
individual merit or capacity. In doing so they have made
an offering to democratic Liberty greater by far than any
attained during the sixty years of Rebellion and Civil War
which began with the dawn of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The immediate results of this unchaining of the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a proletariat which has not yet attained a very high educational
or intellectual level will nevertheless be watched with
interest not unmingled with anxiety by all concerned with
political economy in the abstract and the progress and peaceful
welfare of Argentina in particular.</p>

<p>In this connection it is perhaps remarkable that whereas
the choice of each New President has for many years been a
foregone conclusion during at least the last year or so of his
predecessor’s term of office, no such lengthy period of predestination
was anywhere observable in the case of the
successor to Dr. Victorino de la Plaza, who vacates the
Presidential chair this year.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">RACIAL ELEMENTS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS</span></h2>

<p>What will be the result some generations hence
of the enormous influx of immigration from all
parts of Europe to Argentina and in, as yet, a
much less degree to Uruguay? What manner of man will
the Argentine of the future be when he has completed his
development as a national type? This is a question often
asked, but as to which only the most shadowy answer can
yet be given. The elements which are going to his formation
are so many and the qualities of those elements so difficult
to reckon in regard to their respectively possible likelihood
of survival in the settled type. The most that can be done
here is to enumerate the chief of such elements in their
approximate quantitative values.</p>

<p>The true Argentine of the past is the descendant of the
Spanish conquerors with usually some admixture of native
Indian blood derived from a remote ancestress, while another
less remote has perhaps given him a tinge of black blood in
remembrance of the days when African slave labour tended
his great-grandfather’s sugar canes and maize.</p>

<p>But Spanish blood is predominant and Spanish qualities
distinguish most of the Argentine, and all of the Uruguayan,
leading families of to-day. Ceremoniously courteous to a
fault—the fault of deeming it rude ever to refuse a favour
asked; regarding it as a strange lack of <i lang="fr">savoir vivre</i> on the
part of the suppliant should the latter not understand the
granting as a mere polite formality, in no way to be taken as
a serious engagement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>An Argentine will ask a favour of another as a mere hint
that he would be very glad if the latter granted it; a
stranger ignorant of Argentine manners and ways might ask
it really expecting to receive a substantial response to his
request. Both would be met with a charming if vague assertion
that nothing would give the person asked greater
pleasure than to do anything the asker desired. Each might
attain his object or not, as other considerations dictated;
but whereas the demand would be credited to the former as
finesse, contempt for boorishness would be the lot of the
latter did he present himself expectant of the immediate
fulfilment of the promise. Almost as well might he turn up
unexpectedly to lunch at the home of an Argentine who on
first receiving him had said with a graciously comprehensive
wave of his hand, “This house is yours.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact an Argentine’s home is a very difficult
castle for a stranger to enter.</p>

<p>This probably for two chief reasons. For the first of these
we must trace racial elements back to the Moorish civilization
of Spain and the jealous seclusion of women from all male
eyes but those of close relations. The second is a general lack
of orderliness (also an Oriental characteristic) usually prevailing
in even the richest Argentine households; which
makes it inconvenient to receive except on special and
specially prepared occasions.</p>

<p>We must follow up the Arab-Semitic blood brought in the
veins of the Spaniard to the new world through mingling
with Native Indian and Negro blood before we come to the
heroes who fought for and won independence from Spanish
rule now over a century ago. Since then what intermarryings,
mostly with natives of Italy but also with British,
French, German, Scandinavian and Belgian men and women.</p>

<p>Guthries, Dumas, Murphys, Schneidewinds, Christophersens,
De Bruyns, Bunges, not to mention bearers of the
historic patronymics of Brown and O’Higgins, are now among
the landed aristocracy of Argentina; though, still, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<i lang="fr">crème de la crème</i> consists of the descendants of the Spanish
families of Colonial days. Among the middle and lower
classes, especially in the towns, the Italianate element is
now overwhelming; though recently again Spanish immigration
has begun to exceed Italian. All this goes to make
a strange racial mixture; of which the first generation born
on Argentine soil knows little about and cares nothing for
the language of its parents, but grows up with a pride,
comical to the detached observer, in the glorious Wars of
Independence (fought at a period when its own ancestry
were, as likely as not, peasants in one or another corner of
Europe, and wholly ignorant of the fact of the existence of
the River Plate) and patriotically devoted to the blue and
white Banner and National Anthem (an Italian composition,
by the by) of the land of their parents’ adoption.</p>

<p>Everyone born on Argentine or Uruguayan soil is Argentine
or Uruguayan of his own very decided will as well as
legally; furiously so with the exclusive fervour of the
convert. He cannot or will not speak English, French,
German, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish or Flemish as the case
may be; nothing but Spanish, River Plate Spanish, that is
to say, is worthy of his tongue, and he has a truly Galician
contempt for the lisping Spanish of Castile.</p>

<p>Contrarily to a generally accepted but quite superficial
view, an Uruguayan differs from an Argentine almost if not
quite as much as a Portuguese does from a Spaniard; the
reason being that the early immigration to the two countries
was drawn from different parts of Spain. The first settlement
of what is now Uruguay was chiefly drawn from the
Canary Islands and the Basque Provinces; the latter origin
being easily perceptible from a glance at any list of the names
of prominent Uruguayans, past or present. To this fact
of early settlement and because Uruguay has, until quite
recently, offered much less attraction to the stream of
European Emigration which flowed past Montevideo to
Buenos Aires, is due the possession of the high degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
many sterling qualities which distinguishes Uruguayans from
their cousins of the other shore of the River Plate. These
qualities have sustained the National and individual
financial credit of Uruguay throughout all troubles and
political vicissitudes. She as a Nation and her individual
traders have always paid 100 cents gold to each dollar and
her commercial community has successfully negatived any
attempt on the part of her Governments to depart from the
strictly gold basis of her monetary system. The Uruguayan
dollar is worth slightly more than that of the United States.
This significant fact is due to the uncontaminated preservation
of racial qualities derived through the old Colonists from
the Northern parts of Spain; especially from the Basques,
than whom no honester, nor perhaps more obstinate, people
exist.</p>

<h3>LANGUAGE</h3>

<p>Everyone knows that Spanish is the language of the River
Plate Republics; but, while the written Spanish of South
America is one with literary Spanish all the world over, the
spoken language of Argentina and Uruguay differs from
Castilian in many respects.</p>

<p>The first of these, and probably the most interesting, is
the survival in South America of words in common use in
the days of the early <i lang="es">conquistadores</i> and colonists but which
have long ago fallen into disuse in Spain.</p>

<p>These words gave a deal of trouble a few years ago to
certain Argentine amateur philologists who made more or
less ingenious endeavours to derive them from the aboriginal
Quichúa or Guaraní.</p>

<p>It was reserved for Mr. Paul Groussac, a Frenchman and
the custodian of the Argentine National Library, to inform
these derivation hunters, in a coldly sarcastic little pamphlet,
that they would find all the words that were puzzling them
intact in the works of Cervantes and other old Spanish
authors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>So it is with many Britons not learned in philology.
There are many words and expressions commonly regarded
as Americanisms which in truth went to New England in
the <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<p>There are also several striking differences between the
pronunciation of Spanish on the River Plate and in Spain.
Thus the “ll” which is liquid in pure Castilian is given in
South America a sound very much like the French “j” in
<i lang="fr">je</i>. This, I believe to have come to the New World with the
Galician immigration.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In the beginning of historical times the various Galician
dialects prevailed over the whole Peninsula; Galician subsequently
developing into modern Portuguese and the
Castilian dialect, with much more widely divergent steps of
development, becoming the accepted language of Spain.</p>

<p>Also the Argentine and Uruguayan disdain the lisping
“θ” sound given by Spaniards to the letter “z” and in a
lighter degree to “c.” In South American Spanish “z,”
soft “c” and “s” are indistinguishable to the ear; all
three being given the same sound as an English “s.”
There is also, as might be expected, a distinct difference of
intonation between Spanish as she is spoken in South
America and in Spain. Everyone who has learned to speak
Spanish in a South American country ever afterwards carries
with him oral evidence of the place of origin of that linguistic
acquirement; just as does a foreigner who has learned
English in the United States. So it is with South African
Dutch; and (may it be said?) Australian English. And all
Colonists of either English, Dutch or Spanish origin are
consciously proud of their own particular fashion of speaking
and, either secretly or openly, regard the intonation of the
older country as rather effeminately affected. <i lang="la">De gustibus</i>,
etc.</p>

<p>Really, I suppose, there is no good or bad “accent,” as
these differences of intonation are commonly called. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
like flavour, chiefly, if not entirely, a matter of custom and
taste. <span class="smcap">Pronunciation</span>, however, seems more frequently a
matter of fashion, recurrent as are other fashions in easily
dated periods.</p>

<p>Probably the South American pronunciation of Spanish
mostly dates back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries;
with, perhaps, an added blunt plainness born of generations
of free rough life on the vast expanses of the Pampa.</p>

<p>Modern innovations in the written or spoken language of
Argentina and Uruguay can usually be traced to the great
stream of immigration constantly flowing to these countries,
chiefly from Italy and Spain.</p>

<h3>ARGENTINES AND URUGUAYANS</h3>

<p>The inhabitants of the two Republics of Argentina and
Uruguay are only similar in appearance and natural characteristics
to the superficial or hasty observer. There are
several points in which they really differ fundamentally,
the difference being due, as has just been observed, to
the fact that the original settlements of the two parts
of the River Plate Territories were drawn from different
parts of Spain and that the later cosmopolitan stream of
immigration passed by Montevideo, on account of the
constantly politically disturbed condition of Uruguay, and
disembarked only at Buenos Aires. Therefore the Uruguayan
has retained the characteristics of his Spanish ancestors in
far greater purity than has the Argentine.</p>

<p>It is therefore impossible to club the two peoples together
in any attempt at a description or even indication of their
leading characteristics.</p>

<p>By way of rough comparison it may be said that while
the Argentine has gained in polish and versatility by interbreeding
with immigrants from many European countries,
chiefly from all parts of Italy, the Uruguayan has retained
a very large share of the dogged honesty, obstinacy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
capacity for sustained effort in hard work of his Basque and
Galician ancestors.</p>

<p>In passing from comparison to particular analysis one is
at once confronted with the difficult question, “What is an
Argentine?”</p>

<p>According to Argentine Law, all children born on Argentine
soil are <i lang="la">ipso facto</i> Argentines, but to attempt classification
of the offspring of mixed marriages in several degrees
of remoteness of parentage would immediately become a
complex impossibility. Certain influences, however, imposed
by the life and surroundings in Argentina, affect all
individuals brought up there, no matter what may be or
have been the nationality of their immediate or remoter
ancestry.</p>

<p>But, with this exception, any description or setting forth
of the leading characteristics of “Argentines” can only
safely be submitted in regard to the direct descendants of
the Spanish Conquistadores and early settlers and of the
mixed unions between these and the aboriginal Indian
women. The further but much rarer admixture of African
blood introduced by slave labour, is almost a negligible
quantity in the upper classes, though of considerable and
noticeable influence in the lower, especially in the
Northern Provinces, in which the mixture of Indian and
Negro blood is very considerable.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these elements of Spanish, Indian and
Negro became fused into a national type the picturesqueness
of which is now (alas!) being rapidly absorbed and transformed
in the melting-pot in which it meets strange elements
from every part of civilized Europe.</p>

<p>Still, the chivalrous and courteous Argentine to be found
to-day not only in the National Senate (and in the Presidential
chair), but also in the maize fields and sugar plantations
of the far Western and Northern Provinces cannot be
overlooked either as very important prime material for the
coming race or as possessing many qualities the dilution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which can only be viewed with a sincere, if partly sentimental,
regret.</p>

<p>Are you a travelling stranger? The <i lang="es">gaucho</i> will offer you
of the very best his humble ranch affords with the same
native charm and dignity of manner which will strike you
on your arrival and welcome on the <i lang="es">estancia</i> of his ancestral
overlord.</p>

<p>There are still corners of Argentina where the patriarchal
system has not yet died out, where every <i lang="es">peon</i> and <i lang="es">vaquero</i>
considers himself a child of the great house whose señora
sees to the creature comforts and small luxuries of his wife
and children on feast-days and in the time of need.</p>

<p>No stately old-world courtesy could ever have surpassed
that of an Argentine host of the old school. Truly, on his
estancia, all is yours, and he will frequently make you a
daily offering of fruit, chosen by him, picked with his own
hand, especially and exclusively for you, his guest. The
aristocratic Argentine of the old school is a very dignified
gentleman indeed, notwithstanding a century of democratic
profession. I say “profession,” for though I believe the
leading families of the Republic are quite sincere in a conviction
that they rank among the world’s most advanced
democrats, the government of the country has remained
almost exclusively in their truly patrician hands since the
days of the Declaration of Independence. What may happen
in the present newly commenced era of compulsory exercise
of a universal franchise no one can well say, but most of the
landed influence still belongs to the great historic Argentine
families; who, moreover, form a caste which keeps even
the plutocracy of more recently foreign origin at a quite
respectful distance. It will be a long time, at any rate,
before the prestige of these families ceases to make its
influence felt in the capital as well as in the districts over
which they have ruled for, practically, at least a century.
The apparent familiarity which exists between them and
their dependants or humbler provincial neighbours is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
outcome of the loyal affection which at one time existed in
England between squire and farmer or villager. A feeling
born of and sustained by the patriarchal system and very
widely different to the “I am as good as you are” pretensions
of new democracy.</p>

<p>The true Argentine, be he patrician, estanciero or gaucho
peon is never boorish even when he seeks to pick a quarrel
with studied insult; and if his humour and language would,
at times, severely shock European ears polite, he is studiously
careful to keep that sort of talk for the intimacy of his own
household and associates. If you are admitted to that intimacy,
well, so much the worse for you, if you are of a prudish
disposition, but you can console yourself that your privilege
is a very special and rare one; bestowed on you by virtue
of some exceptionally sympathetic quality with which your
host’s kindly imagination has endowed you. He is a kindly,
charitable man, the real Argentine: an odd mixture of infantile
vanity and strong common sense, hospitable to anyone
arriving at his house through force of circumstance or if
he can find a reasonable excuse to himself for breaking
through the rule of almost hareem-like privacy of his home
and intimate family affairs. Courteous himself, he expects
courtesy, and will not brook clumsiness of speech or manner.
Leisurely in his ways, he will not be hustled over any
business. Try to hurry him, and he not only resents your
lack of good manners but also suspects that you are endeavouring
to lead him into some kind of sharp-dealing
trap. Anyway, he not only will not budge an inch from his
own deliberate attitude but most probably will oppose the
inertia of a closed front door to all your further endeavours
to approach him. This Argentine characteristic is a rock
on which many a Yankee hustler has seen his best thought-out
propositions founder.</p>

<p>In any business or other intercourse with a true Argentine
you must not expect him to keep verbally made appointments
nor to apologize subsequently for not having done so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Usually you need not trouble to keep them yourself. Whatever
you have in hand with him will prosper better and
progress just as, or even more, quickly if you are content to
take the matter up where you left it at your last interview,
the next time you happen to meet him by chance at any at
all convenient place or time. Do not talk him to death
about it, he is very quick at understanding your wishes and
proposed plans from the merest hint. If not, he will ask you
very plain questions.</p>

<p>But <em>he</em> must conduct the negotiations, <em>he</em> must clothe
your ideas until they bear a respectable appearance of being
of his own originating. That is his vanity; but only then
may you venture to strip them of certain new features
which on close examination will be seen to be more favourable
to his interests than your own.</p>

<p>During the changes which your propositions will inevitably
undergo in the course of negotiations, he may, if you are not
careful, get the better of you in the deal. That also is his
vanity; a vanity to guard against without ever committing
the solecism of a too bluntly apparent discovery of his aim.
If he finds you always politely firm as a gentleman should
be, you will have gained his friendship and respect—often
valuable assets even if your original business should not go
through.</p>

<p>In a word, in Argentina, as elsewhere, one must respect
the native customs and conventionalities unless one wishes
to encounter opposition. And the <i lang="la">vis inertia</i> of the
opposition which an Argentine can and does offer to
persons and ideas with which he is out of sympathy is
invincible.</p>

<p>Such persons or schemes will be remitted by him to a
“Mañana” which never comes.</p>

<p>That is the true inward meaning in Argentina of mañana;
a polite excuse for temporarily or definitely postponing
matters which have not made a favourable impression. It
is not, as is so often thought, a mere lazy pretext for not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
doing to-day anything that possibly can be put off till to-morrow.</p>

<p>The Argentine is not in the least lazy. On the contrary,
he has reserve stores of latent energy the sudden calling into
action of which, when he considers such action called for, is
apt to astonish those who have formed superficial and hasty
judgments on his nature.</p>

<p>It would seem trite to say that the first step to success in
a country is intelligent study of the inhabitants were it not
so constantly evident that new arrivals, who really ought to
know better, seem to bring with them the idea that along
with their business, whatever it may be, they have brought
a mission to mould Argentine methods on the latest European
or North American forms, forms which are the outcome
of entirely different racial and climatic conditions. Thus,
they, at the outset, impose upon themselves the Sisyphus
task of rolling their pet stones up the hill of customs which
really are the outcome of the racial and physical necessities
of the people and country.</p>

<p>You cannot grow wheat in a swamp nor make much of a
retriever out of a pointer, but the swamp may yield good
rice and a pointer may be a very good dog in his way.</p>

<p>The sooner an immigrant, be he financier or farmer,
realizes such facts the better for his success on the River
Plate or elsewhere. By not doing so he fails in his enterprise
and blames the failure on to the people or country to which
he took projects predoomed only by his own lack of intelligent
adaptability.</p>

<p>Another word of didactic advice to the intending emigrant
to Argentina. Always be sure, no matter what his appearance
and manners may seem to indicate to your first glance
at him, that every action of an Argentine is firmly founded
on a perfectly common-sense view of circumstances and their
influence on his own best interests, although that foundation
may lie under, and, for those who do not really know him,
be hidden by various strata of personal vanity and easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
aroused but ephemeral enthusiasm. He is no fool and most
emphatically not a lazy man, but only one who is rather
cynically apt to let other people work for him as much
and as often as they will. When he cannot get things
done for him he can and will do them, very effectively, for
himself.</p>

<p>And lest, to some people, the foregoing observations and
counsel might seem so much word-embroidery on a canvas
composed mostly of the author’s imagination, the reader is
humbly asked to compare it with the known facts of Argentine
economic history.</p>

<p>In 1810, the beginning of the country’s real development,
the great River Plate landowner was a rural patriarch,
much after the fashion of the shepherd kings of Palestine.</p>

<p>He ousted the Master-Stranger from his land and only
afterwards permitted him and encouraged him to return to
it as the servant of himself, the true overlord of the soil.
On that soil its patriarchs extended their proprietary rights
ever more and more while foreign railways and all kinds of
other enterprise constantly enhanced the value of the land
held, always almost exclusively, by Argentines. His railway
and dock-building servants from overseas got very good
wages indeed for their work, as they still do in common with
others who have made tramways and constructed water, gas
and electrical power works. But he who up to now has had
the most durable and the chief profit from all this is the
Argentine or Uruguayan; the man who holds and will hold
the Government of the two Republics and retains all the
appreciated value of the much greater part of the soil of their
vast territories. Concessions of land to foreigners made in
the past by way of part wages are nowadays secretly regarded
as having been errors committed in ignorance of the real
value of what was then parted with and with such self-accusation
of error goes the resolve not to repeat it. Still it
should be stated that at the time of making such grants
some such inducement was necessary in a part of the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which had only very recently emerged from half a century
of civil war.</p>

<p>It is, of course, self-evident that no new railway enterprise
will get a huge grant of land; as did the Central Argentine
Company as an inducement to construct. The attitude of
the Argentine to-day to all foreigners is that they may come
to his country and there enjoy similar rights and liberties
with himself coupled with rather less than his own responsibilities.
They may keep the profits they make, and very
good profits are obtainable by well-conducted, necessary
enterprise, after deduction of certain percentage by way of
rent for their concessions or licences; but the real property,
the value of which is constantly being increased by the
activity of foreign industry and commerce, remains in, and
even as to formerly alienated parts of it gradually tends to
drift more and more into, native hands.</p>

<p>The Argentine is, as I have said, not a fool, even still less
is the Uruguayan; on the contrary, he is especially wise in
his appreciation of his own natural limitations. He is by
long heredity and his own upbringing a farmer, not a commercial
man nor a speculator in aught else but land. And
to land, therefore as well as for the other good reasons
already pointed out, he devotes his best attention.</p>

<p>He cannot, perhaps, build nor manage railways, nor has
he generally a genius for banking, but he can and does breed
as fine cattle and sheep and grow as good quality maize and
wheat as any imported European farm manager. In farming,
the special subject which he does thoroughly understand, he
gives practical evidence of his judgment in assimilation of
the best farming science and of adapting it, or such part
of it as is most capable of adaptation, to the conditions and
requirements of his own particular lands.</p>

<p>The finest and the most up-to-date model estancias in
Argentina and Uruguay belong to and have been brought
to their present state of perfection by Argentines and
Uruguayans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably these facts dispose of the accusation of dilatory
laziness so often brought against him.</p>

<p>In this chapter I have attempted to inform intending
emigrants and not to formulate a defence of the Argentine
or Uruguayan against the ignorance of his calumniators.
He needs none. With a charmingly cynical indifference,
which is all his own but which it does not at all times suit his
interests to manifest, he goes on piling up colossal fortunes
amid surroundings much more congenial to his nature than
even the European Grand Hotels or Cafés in which he likes
from time to time to disport himself and display his wealth.
His estancia always remains his home, in which he spends the
best and greatest portion of his life, surrounded by the peons
whose great-grandfathers were vassals of his own.</p>

<p>It is rather the fashion among new arrivals in Buenos
Aires and Montevideo to laugh at the Argentines and Uruguayans
and their ways of managing their affairs, but it
appears to me that this is a case of “He laughs best who
laughs last.” The native of the River Plate has contrived
to get his country developed for him while retaining the
entire mastery of it. Men of long residence in these countries
have practically adopted their manners and customs simply
because experience has taught them that such are best
adapted to these countries’ natural conditions. As has been
observed earlier in this chapter, the Argentine, especially, is
conscious of his own limitations, one of the chief of which is
a pretty general incapacity for patient attention to detail in
his work. His scientific acquirements are often brilliant as
far as study is concerned. He assimilates knowledge rapidly
and accurately, but in its application he is often too apt to
fail of obtaining satisfactory results just and only because
of his lack of patience and appreciation of the value of detail
in practice. That is why he prudently abandoned his own
past attempts to control certain of his railways which,
financial failures under his management, quickly became
prosperous concerns in British hands. His hospitals still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
show many defects due solely to the lack of attention to
necessary details on the part of the medical staff. Brilliant
exceptions, which unfortunately do not vitiate this rule, are
to be found in Mr. Lertora, the Argentine manager of the
Western Railway, and Dr. Penna, the President of the
National Council of Hygiene and the creator of the magnificently
managed Asistencia Publica of Buenos Aires and
of all the great sanitary works of that city.</p>

<p>To sum up the average Argentine of the upper classes, in
middle age and onward he is a grave and reverend señor; a
rather wild and boisterous young gentleman until he has
sown a profusion of wild oats.</p>

<p>Throughout his life he shows a childlike pride in his wealth
and all it can give to him and his, is lavish in largesse with
occasional and seemingly capricious moments of close-fistedness.
Courteous to a fault in manner, he has nevertheless
ever a keen eye for the main chance in all matter of sufficient
magnitude to really interest him.</p>

<p>In fact he has many characteristics which are reminiscent
of the less objectionable qualities of mediæval nobility, in
common with whom he is quick to resent anything he deems
intentional insult to or disparagement of himself. He will
forgive anyone for having got the better of him in a deal
(though it is fair to him to say that it is not often he finds
himself the victim of such an offence), but he will not for any
consideration brook clumsily bad manners. He is by no
means a puritanical moralist nor severe on the moral peccadillos
of his neighbours, and he leaves religion pretty much
to his women-folk.</p>

<p>In the lower classes he is still always courteous, expects
courtesy from others, and resents, quickly and often fiercely,
any defect in that respect in his neighbour’s behaviour.</p>

<p>Neither will he brook pretentious arrogance in any man,
his social superior or his equal. Such arrogance meets immediately
not only with his quick resentment but his profound
and evident disdain. Treat him as he will treat you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and you will find him uniformly pleasant, light-hearted and
humorous. Obligatory education is slowly freeing him from
the illiteracy which until recently was very general, especially
outside the limits of the Capital or one or other of the largest
towns. Even now the lower-class Argentine is usually an
exceedingly poor scholar. Therefore, and because of his
rapidly growing admixture of Italian peasant blood, he is
superstitious and still often has a deeper faith in fortune-telling
quacks than in qualified medical science. Wise men
and women are still much consulted for love-potions and
cures and curses of all sorts for man and beast in the country
districts, but while mere fortune-tellers are not interfered
with by the law, penal restrictions are being more and
more stringently enforced against quack doctors; most of
whose remedies have come direct from mediæval Spain or
Italy.</p>

<p>Argentine women? This is a subject on which one is not
only tempted but almost forced to confine oneself to the
usual platitudes concerning beauty of the Spanish type:
large-eyed and opulent and at its apogee during the decade
between 15 and 25 years of age.</p>

<p>It is seldom that an Argentine woman of any class troubles
her head with business matters; still less with theories concerning
the rights of her sex. She is usually content to do
her most apparent duty in the sphere to which it has pleased
God to call her.</p>

<p>She manages her household in a quasi-Oriental haphazard
way; if of the wealthier classes does little but order that
household in such ways as may correspond to her momentary
caprice, if of the poorer, naturally, she does the work herself,
but in the same capricious fashion.</p>

<p>Saturday is the great day for domestic cleaning up
throughout all classes, Sunday a feast day whereon little
work is done.</p>

<p>Apart from these general fixtures, household duties may
be said never to be begun and never finished. In all houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
one may see the servants or the housewife, as the case may
be, besom in one hand and <i lang="es">mate</i> in the other at any time of
day. What is not done to-day is finished to-morrow, that
is all; and what can one do more?</p>

<p>To newly arrived Europeans these methods give an idea
of continual discomfort, but the sooner such Europeans
become accustomed to the ways of the country in this as in
other matters the better for their own peace of mind. Of
one thing they may be assured from the commencement of
their stay on the River Plate, viz. that it is not they who will
change those ways by an iota, and that therefore they may
as well abandon all notions of what they would consider as
reform of good grace to begin with instead of at the end of a
more or less lengthy nerve-racking struggle.</p>

<p>The servant difficulty is particularly difficult in these
sunny lands where no one need, and very few do, know what
it is to suffer the real pinch of want or of hardship other than
such as custom sanctions. The European lady who worries
her servants with, to them, new ideas of how her household
should be conducted will simply cause them to quit her
employ with wonderful unanimity and celerity.</p>

<p>They won’t stop, that is all. She may give them sleeping
or other accommodation which they may never before have
enjoyed nor probably even dreamed of. These attentions
strike no sympathetic chord if they be accompanied by what
the native Argentine considers silly pettiness of interference
with the way in which he or she is accustomed to do his or
her work. Any Argentine servant would sooner sleep, as
many do, on a mattress thrown down at night in any passage
way in the house of a native Argentine family and suffer the
alternate friendly familiarity and impassioned scolding of a
mistress whose ways they understand and who leaves them
to theirs, than occupy the nicest possible servant’s bedroom
in a more strictly ordered establishment. The true and main
lesson of all which is that the Argentine, to whatever social
class he or she may belong, is a child of nature to whom disciplinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fetters of any kind are unbearable and to the freer
nature of whom the monotony of much of the punctual
regularity which Europeans are apt to consider a necessary
factor of real comfort is impossibly burdensome.</p>

<p>On the River Plate one must live as the Rio Platenseans do
if one’s stay is not to be one continued struggle for unattainable
domestic ideals. In the best hotels, in the millionaire’s
palace or the peon’s hut the same happy-go-lucky spirit
prevails and dominates domestic, as it also does public, life,
in especially, perhaps, Argentina. Everything is muddled
through somehow. But it <em>is</em> muddled through to desired
results, which, after all, is the chief practical desideratum.</p>

<p>There is much of the Spanish seclusion in the better-class
home life of both Argentina and Uruguay, which adds to the
obstacles in the way of criticism or appreciation by a
foreigner.</p>

<p>That the children are almost universally what we should
call spoiled is, however, evident from the most superficial
experience of that life. The Argentine theories, if they can
be termed such, of bringing up are largely controlled by a
fear of crushing the individuality of the child especially if
he be a boy. The most usual reply of an Argentine child
to any order given to it is “No quiero” (I don’t want to),
and there the matter ends. The parents smile indulgently,
the child does not do what it did not want to do, and woe
betide the governess or tutor who is possessed of too strict
disciplinary ideas. Thus, from the cradle to the grave the
male Argentine is used to his own sweet way, while his sisters
are made to feel few trammels of a purely household kind.
These apart, however, Argentine women seldom, if ever,
show any symptoms of rebellion against the domestic
seclusion which is their accepted lot, especially after marriage.</p>

<p>The Argentine woman is seldom disturbed by intellectual
aspirations, likes creature comforts and facilities for the
standard of dress pertaining to her station, and she is
contented and happy in her home with the theatre as a distraction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
At the theatre she only favours performances
which demand intellectual effort for their appreciation if
and when fashion impels her attendance thereat; so that
she may see and be seen in the foyer and hold pleasant receptions
in her box, receptions not always confined to the
<i lang="fr">extr’actes</i>.</p>

<p>In a word, she is not intellectual and therefore feels no
need for troubling her usually handsome head with intellectuality.</p>

<p>She is a wife and a mother and a lady bountiful to all the
feudal dependants of her husband’s house. Childishly fond
of dress and admiration but with as little desire for liberty
of action as she has for deep thought.</p>

<p>As will have been gathered from the foregoing, much of
the Moorish civilization in Spain remains reincarnate in the
woman of modern Argentina.</p>

<p>A word may very well be said here for the much-criticized
Argentine <i lang="fr">jeunesse dorée</i>. In the author’s humble opinion
the real wonder about him is that his sometimes objectionably
intrusive boisterousness in public places does not outstep
its actually not very wide limitations.</p>

<p>In any other country, if you had a warm-blooded young
scion of a sunny land who had grown up under the almost
constantly approving smiles of an indulgent father and
mother, possessed of great wealth and traditions of spending
freely on amusement and outward display and, lastly, a
native police which would almost as soon dare to rebel
openly against the Government as to lock up for anything
short of serious and unconcealable crime any son of a great
ruling family, it appears to me more than possible that you
would have much more trouble with such a gilded youth,
who, moreover, would probably succumb to early physical
and financial ruin instead of developing, as has been said,
into a grave and reverend señor, capable in either Chamber
of Congress or in a ministerial or diplomatic capacity, as the
Argentine <i lang="fr">fils de famille</i> eventually does. That he does so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
develop and does not succumb, I attribute to his underlying
quality of common sense, coupled with his mainly open-air
upbringing in the <i lang="es">Camp</i>.</p>

<p>Also, the young Argentine may be and often is, exceedingly
fond of sowing a vast quantity of wild oats, but he is very
seldom ill-natured or fundamentally bad. His very vices
are strongly tempered with redeemingly generous qualities.</p>

<p>As good a comparison as any I can hit on between the
upper-class Argentine and his Uruguayan cousin is that of
the smart Londoner and the resident in a provincial Cathedral
town. The latter is less given to display of such wealth as
he may have and much less likely to make any pretence of
greater. The Uruguayan is usually unpretentious in his way
of living and at the same time gives an impression of greater
solidity if more modest dimensions of fortune. Among
both there is the same aristocratic assuredness of social
position; but whereas each better-class Argentine seeks to
outvie his immediate associates in luxurious outward
appearance, the Uruguayan is content with a more solid
if less showy all-round level of comfort. If one may use so
discredited a term, the Uruguayan is the much more
“eminently respectable” of the two, a man who derives
his greatest pride from the fact that his word always has
been and is every bit as good as his bond.</p>

<p>He has some contempt for Argentine showiness; while on
the other side of the River Plate estuary he himself is considered
as too slow-going to be very interesting. The
Argentine is certainly jealous of the sounder general credit
enjoyed by Uruguay, a jealousy not soothed by a certain
quiet assumption of superiority of a nation which has
always turned a deaf ear to any suggestions of convenient
financial juggling, however critical or difficult the times.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt but that while the Uruguayan is
possessed of common sense in much the same degree as is the
Argentine, this quality is in the former tempered by a large
quantum of Quixotic obstinacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Roughly speaking—very roughly, for generalization is
almost as hazardous as prophecy—it may be said that while
the Argentine is often apt to be guided rather by opportunism
than fixed principle, the Uruguayan will only begin
to listen to the voice of opportunity when he feels sure that
no one of his inflexible principles is likely to be affected by
so doing.</p>

<p>As we have seen, both the <em>White</em> and <em>Red</em> political parties
in Uruguay have over and over again racked the whole
country with civil war for the defence or assertion of pure
principles, in regard to which no compromise seemed possible
to one side or the other.</p>

<p>Argentina also had her period of Civil War brought about
in a very great measure, no doubt, by similar causes; but her
politicians have during the last fifty years learned the
pecuniary value of, at least apparent, adaptability.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan of to-day is just as inflexible in his convictions
as he was a century ago, and if he now chooses
peace rather than civil war it is because he has become
sincerely persuaded that peace is the only real way to his
country’s best good and prosperity. Peace with honour,
that is to say. He would rather commit public or individual
suicide than accept any other.</p>

<p>For this reason (and for others) there is no likelihood of
the Banda Oriental ever becoming a part of Argentina.
Uruguayans could never be peacefully governed by Argentine
policy, and Argentina would never wish to be burdened
by such a troublesome community as would be the Uruguayans
if they should come under her nominal rule. As
historical fact, Argentina has already refused Uruguayan
territory as a gift, and acted wisely in such refusal.</p>

<p>The lower classes and rural populations of Argentina and
Uruguay differ, <i lang="la">pari passu</i>, as much and in similar fashion,
from one another as do their respective social superiors,
though Camp life is in many ways Camp life in both Republics
alike. But ruggedly uncompromising staunchness to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
principles which he has adopted for his own—which, however,
may differ from European standards—is as evident in
the Uruguayan peon as in his master.</p>

<p>Once you really know the Argentine or the Uruguayan, it
is seldom difficult to forecast what either will do in any
given circumstances. Needless, perhaps, to add that your
study of them must be sympathetic; as must all such study
in order to obtain positive or any at all satisfactory results.</p>

<span class="smaller">NATIONAL, PROVINCIAL, AND MUNICIPAL
GOVERNMENT</span></h2>

<p>The Constitutions of Argentina and Uruguay differ
chiefly in that while the former gives a large
measure of autonomy to the Provinces (therein,
as in other respects, being closely modelled on that of the
United States), the latter does not, the whole legislative
power being vested in the National Congress.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Argentina has 14 Provinces and 11 National Territories,
including the district of the Federal Capital, the city of
Buenos Aires. Each of the Provinces has a Governor and
a Parliament of its own, chosen by the local electorate, and
possesses, as has been said, a very large measure of autonomy
in the management of its own fiscal and other internal
affairs. Other large areas which are not yet judged by
Congress to have attained sufficient development to be able
to support the financial burdens and status of autonomous
Provinces have remained <em>National Territories</em> under the
direct control of the National Government. The Municipal
Council of the Federal Capital has wide administrative
powers, always subject, however, to the sanction of the
National Executive, and the “Lord Mayor” (Intendente
Municipal) of Buenos Aires is appointed by the National
Government.</p>

<p>The National Territory likely to be the first promoted to
the rank of a Province is that of the <span class="smcap">Pampa Central</span>; now
one of the chief cereal areas of the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The Argentine Provinces and National Territories are the

<p>It should be added that all Public Acts and Judicial
Decisions of one Province have legal effect in all the others.
Sometimes, however, conflicts of jurisdiction afford matter
for the decision of the Federal High Court.</p>

<p>Uruguay is divided into 19 <span class="smcap">Departments</span>, each of which

<p>It is perhaps not convenient here to discuss the comparative
advantages of the two systems; but it must be
said that evidence of the defects inherent to the qualities
of both is not lacking. In Argentina the Provinces and in
Uruguay the National Governments have frequently shown
and still show a disposition to make ells out of the inches
given them by their respective constitutions.</p>

<p>In Argentina this disposition was considerably scotched
though not killed by the Centralizing policy of Dr. Figueroa
Alcorta, the immediate predecessor in the Presidential chair
of the recently deceased Dr. Roque Saenz Peña. Dr. Alcorta’s
policy was fundamentally good and was carried out by him
with, doubtless, the best of motives, if the manner of its
execution was rather Gilbertian.</p>

<p>The evils he attacked arose from the fact that each of the
more distant Provinces was practically under the almost
autocratic domination of a great land-owning family; the
descendants, usually, of the lords of the soil in the patriarchal
days of the River Plate countries.</p>

<p>In those Provinces these families and their nearer ramifications
formed powerful oligarchies; ruling over people
who in their turn were the descendants of those who in bygone
days had been little else than the vassals of the Great
House. The head of the leading family was the Governor of
his Province by an almost acknowledged right of inheritance;
while his sons, nephews, and sons-in-law occupied the chief
posts in the Provincial Government.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that these people had, in measure
as the National Government became more and more perfected
in its conduct and outlook, become an insufferable
obstacle to uniformity of ordered conduct of public affairs.
Especially was this so in financial matters.</p>

<p>The outlying and, mostly, poorer Provinces were always
needing, or at any rate wanting, money; and at the same
time not over-nice about their lack of unpledged security
when they found a European financier, as untrammelled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
scruple as they themselves, willing to engineer a further
Provincial loan under the independent borrowing powers
given by the Constitution to each Province. Some of them
also wished to continue and even increase the issue of notes
the value of which was shockingly depreciated, and which
were only legal tender within the boundaries of the particular
Province. Almost in vain, the National Government issued
diplomatic and consular circulars to the effect that Provincial
loans were not Argentine National loans, and that
it, the National Government, would only hold itself responsible
for the latter. The financiers who floated new
Provincial loans were well aware that the majority of those
persons whom they could induce to take up such bonds
knew little or nothing of the distinction between National
and Provincial. The loan was an Argentine one; puffed
with perfectly true statistics of the progress and prosperity
of the Argentine Republic—without too much insistence on
that of the particular Province concerned. Besides, these
financiers and, possibly, some of their clients calculated on
the extreme probability of the National Government, if an
awkward situation really did arise, not allowing its Provinces
to be declared defaulters in Europe, because of
the consequent slur which must inevitably, though unjustly,
fall on the name of “Argentina”; a name the
credit of which the untiring and scrupulous efforts of
the National Government have built up since the crisis
of 1891.</p>

<p>The Provincial Oligarchies had also other ways of jockeying
National Government. They would ask for all sorts
of things, and if refused would proceed to rant shamelessly in
the Senate. This was blackmail, nothing more nor less;
but frequently effective, since Provincial Governors are
practically always members of the National Senate; in
which the President must, obviously, have a majority if he
is to carry on the Government.</p>

<p>Such situations Dr. Figueroa Alcorta determined to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in hand; and the only way of doing this was to break up
the offending Oligarchies.</p>

<p>Much of the humour of his doing so lay in the fact that he
owed his high post to an original miscalculation of his character
as that of a pleasant enough figure-head certain to be
docile in the hands of the wire-pullers. Therefore he was
appointed Vice-President to be a negligible quantity under
the Presidency of Dr. Manuel Quintana. On whose death he,
<i lang="la">ipso facto</i>, under the Constitution, became acting President
for the remainder of Dr. Quintana’s term of office. The
developments of Dr. Figueroa Alcorta were as much a surprise
to Argentine politicians as were those of Bret Harte’s
“Heathen Chinee” to his associates in “the game he did
not understand.” And realization came as late in the day in
the one case as in the other.</p>

<p>A veritable epidemic of local Revolutions sprang up in one
after the other of the oligarchically ruled Provinces. On
each occasion an “Interventor” was, as is provided by the
Constitution for such cases, sent down by the National
Government to enquire into the causes of the disturbance,
and particularly to ascertain if the Province concerned were
being ruled “in accordance with the Constitution and democratic
principles.” If the answer to this last question were
found to be in the affirmative, National troops could be sent
down to support the existing Provincial Government; if in
the negative, the ruling party, including, of course, the
Governor, could be deposed and a successor appointed by
the National Government in his stead.</p>

<p>As a result it gradually (but not till it was very nearly all
over) dawned on the general intelligence of the country that
the Governors who had been found to have ruled their
Provinces “in accordance with the constitution, etc.,” were
faithful supporters of the Presidential policy; whilst those
who had been deposed for misrule happened, strangely
enough, to be those who had kicked over, or shown an overt
disposition to kick over, the Presidential traces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>This appealed to the public sense of humour and “Revolución
de arriba” (Revolution from above, <i lang="la">i.e.</i> instigated in
high quarters<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>) became a catch phrase. Thus were the
Oligarchies brought to naught and the central power greatly
strengthened thereby.</p>

<p>Dr. Figueroa Alcorta’s crowning <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i> was, however,
his shutting Congress out of its own Palace in consequence of
its conspired refusal to pass one of his budgets. One fine
day, the National Senators and Deputies on reaching the
Congress building found it in possession of troops who refused
them admission. Remonstrance was unavailing, and they
perforce returned home. Meanwhile, the President passed
the Budget himself, as the Constitution gives him power to
do “when Congress is not sitting.”</p>

<p>In the result Dr. Figueroa Alcorta’s Budget (which was a
perfectly wise and necessary one) remained operative and
the officer who had commanded the troops was heavily
fined for disrespect shown to the sacred offices of Senator
and Deputy. The gallant officer’s plea in defence that the
President whose orders he had obeyed on that occasion was,
as constitutional Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, his
Military Superior, availed him nothing. Nobody else was
one penny the worse. Possibly, the payment of Colonel
Calazza’s fine came “de arriba” like the Revolutions.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Dr. Figueroa Alcorta was the courteous
and diplomatic host of Personages (including the Infanta
Isabella) at the 1910 Centenary Festivities; and, shortly
after that again, vacated the Presidential chair in favour of
Dr. Saenz Peña, his successor “by consent.” The usual
and graceful, though officially unacknowledged, custom in
Argentina being that the Presidential Election shall follow
a prearranged course.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>With the matter of elections Dr. Saenz Peña’s name is, as
has been said, intimately and honourably associated, and it
may be repeated that by his death the Republic lost one of
its most broad-minded and straightforward statesmen.</p>

<p>Up to the passing of his Electoral Reform Law, no self-respecting
private citizen ever dreamed of voting: simply
because if he favoured the Government policy his doing so
would be a mere work of supererogation, while if he held
opposition views it would be sheer waste of time and trouble
on his part; and if he were a provincial voter he would
certainly find himself the object of unpleasant attention by
the police, whose really chief duty was to “conduct”
elections to the satisfaction of the ruling party. Anyhow,
his voting could not influence the preordained result of the
election one way or the other. Voting was done by the mere
deposit of a “Libreta” or certificate of citizenship, and
libretas deposited in favour of the ruling party were subject
to little scrutiny as to whether the persons named in them
were alive or dead. They were thrown in at the polling
stations in bundles. Some were bought; though at a low
figure, because there were thousands of blank libretas at
Government House ready to be filled in by quick-writing
clerks in the very remote event of any booth being reported
to have received a disconcerting number of votes adverse
to the Government.</p>

<p>In the Provinces the proceedings were rougher and
readier; the comparative smallness of the communities
enabling the Police Commissary to know the political views
of all persons in his district. Did a would-be opponent of
the ruling powers heave in sight, he was hustled as if to make
room for others who had arrived before him, and if he were
still foolish enough to persist in trying to vote he was arrested
for making a disturbance, and locked up till the election was
over. The Provincial Police Authorities could hardly be
blamed for their share in this scandal, because the successful
conduct of elections was really a <i lang="la">sine qua non</i> condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
their tenure of office. Failure meant for them being almost
immediately superseded.</p>

<p>In Uruguay, no matter whether Reds or Whites (the two
great political parties) were in power, the rural population,
the true backbone of the agricultural country, were perennially
in opposition: because they found that the atmosphere
of the capital somehow or another always infected
their rulers with ideas of government which, however
splendid they might be in theory, were more often than not
quite out of harmony with, and often contradictory to,
practical agricultural needs and conditions.</p>

<p>Thus, to cite an instance often referred to in this regard, it
is not long since a German agricultural expert, specially imported
with the best of intentions by the Government,
showed them that wheat allowed to mature for a while in
stacks had a greater commercial value in Europe than that
thrashed simultaneously with reaping and shipped immediately.
This is, in itself, undeniable fact; from which, however,
the Uruguayan Government drew the conclusion that
it would be well to pass a law making it obligatory, under
penalty for not doing so, on every farmer in the country to
stack all his wheat for a certain period before sending it for
export. This proposal naturally raised an outcry throughout
the country. Because a practice which presents little
practical inconvenience and much advantage in an European
country, where small wheat fields and a more or less damp
climate are the rule, would be monstrously ridiculous in a
land where grain is grown by the square league, and where,
accidents of weather apart, the standing crops are well
dried by the sun. Just imagine the enormous expense involved
in stacking wheat over such vast areas as are covered
by cereals in the River Plate countries. In which countries,
moreover, the greatest of all difficulties in the way of production
is the scarcity of labour! The stacking method
would cost vastly more than the difference in the value
between stacked and unstacked grain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Needless to say, this brilliantly conceived law was never
passed; but the idea of it stands as an example of the
doctrinaire tendencies of Montevidean statesmen of which
the rural industries complain.</p>

<p>That there is a mysterious something in the air of Montevideo
which influences men in the direction of abstract
idealism, and at the same time blinds them to facts which
their cherished theories will not fit, seems undeniable. But
it is unlikely that Uruguay will ever again be plunged into
the ruinous throes of Revolution.</p>

<p>Once the leaders of Uruguayan opinion grasped the fact
that Revolution is the greatest possible impediment to the
best interests of the country, the peaceful future of the
Republic was assured; and they now seem to have grasped
it clearly and firmly.</p>

<p>State insurance, State railways, State tramways, water
and gas works, electrical power stations and, in fact, State
everything was Señor Batlle’s<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> plan for holding Uruguay
up to the world as a splendid object-lesson in State Socialism.
Here again one sees the fire of patriotism gleaming through
a mass of practical difficulties (the obtaining of necessary
capital for the purpose, and on the necessary conditions of
the execution of such splendid plans, for instance) in the
way of the accomplishment of the President’s dream.</p>

<p>Equally patriotic were those who endeavoured to keep the
brakes well pressed on to the wheels of the “progressive”
Presidential car; hoping for the conclusion of Señor
Batlle y Ordoñez’s term of office before too much harm
were done. But, mark this, not a sign of overt rebellion
in a situation over which only a few years ago the
whole country would have been engaged in a fratricidal
struggle.</p>

<p>Señor Batlle y Ordoñez was an autocratic democrat;
desiring and firmly, even obstinately, determined, to rule as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
absolutely as any Tsar in what he conceived to be the true
interests of all classes of the population.</p>

<p>The present writer well remembers hearing him, on the
first day of the great general strike of 1911, addressing the
strikers from the balcony of Government House at Montevideo.</p>

<p>He told them that were it not for his high office he would
be among them and with them; counselled them to stand
firmly for their rights; and wound up with a warning that
any acts of intimidation or violence on their part would not
only injure their just cause, but expose the guilty parties to
extremely severe punishment.</p>

<p>By way of underlining this last wholesome admonition,
Martial Law was immediately declared, and the next day
saw the town filled with Horse, Foot and Artillery. This
move (which caused some doubt in the mind of the extreme
Labour Party as to which way the Presidential wind was
really blowing), and the fact that the flags, illuminations and
firework installations were already nailed up for the celebration
of the Centenary of Artígas, the National Hero,
whose memory has of late years been completely whitewashed
by the National Historians, caused the strike to
fizzle out and all hands to join, a day or two later, in festivities
the brilliance of which confirmed the reputation of the
Montevideans as past masters of artistic illumination.</p>

<p>The only net result of the strike appeared to be the fining,
in the strict terms of its concession, of the Montevideo
Tramways Company for neglecting to run cars according to
schedule during a period when it was physically impossible
for it to have done so. When no bread was baked and even
doctors were forced by the strike leaders to abandon the use
of their carriages; when, in fact, the whole city kept a
sabbath during which no man might do any manner of work.
A state of things enforced by patrols of strikers armed with
revolvers—until the troops of their friend the President
suddenly appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Of both Argentina and Uruguay it may be said that their
Constitutions, Laws (National and Provincial) and Municipal
by-laws and regulations are as nearly perfect models of
what such things should be as can well be imagined. If
they were not sometimes honoured in the breach of them and
if isolated provisions were not sometimes hauled out to meet
cases pretty obviously not exactly contemplated by their
framers, all would be even better in lands where, on the
whole, Laws and Regulations, as occasionally varied by tacit
custom, generally work very well indeed. Such custom, it
should be noted here, is not, however, altogether reliable and
would be useless as a defence in the frequently recurring
event of some Authority or other, perhaps piqued by an
ambition to distinguish itself or to be revenged on a torpid
liver, suddenly insisting on the observance of the strict
letter of the law. In that case, several unsuspecting people
get fined; journalists are inspired for paragraphs and even
articles; a, say, three days’ wonder is created; and custom
resumes her sway until the next temporary upheaval.</p>

<p>The writer once lived in a district of Argentina where, as
elsewhere in that country, all dairy farmers must, under
penalty, use milk cans duly certified and marked by the
Authority appointed for that purpose, as being according to
standard measure. A fee is payable on each can so certified.
One day, being in a curious mood, one not uncommon in
journalists, he asked Authority to show him the standard
measures. The latter, a good fellow, was pleased to consider
the writer as another; so he laughed and said he had never
seen nor asked to have such a thing. He knew that all these
milk-cans were turned out accurately enough by the manufacturers.
So what was the use of bothering further? He
just marked them and took the fee.</p>

<p>Some day, he or his successor or a colleague of some other
district, will be caught by some Higher Authority in a fit of
zeal and made an example of. Someone will get a profitable
contract to furnish Standard milk-cans throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Republic, these will duly get lost or be appropriated by
Authority’s wife for household purposes, and dairymen’s
cans will be certified on sight as before.</p>

<p>It is only just to say that this story is rather illustrative of
Argentine life than Uruguayan: the Uruguayan generally
takes more strict a view of his duties and obligations than
his over-river cousin.</p>

<p>But to return to our subject. Generally speaking, and
especially in Argentina with its Provincial Autonomy, the
further one journeys from the National Capital the slacker
and more irregular one finds the administration of Laws and
By-Laws, the greater the resemblance of the manners and
methods of Authority to that of the Kadi under a palm tree.
And the more one realizes the truth of the proverb that while
one man may steal a horse another may not look over a gate.
In country districts personal influence is wellnigh everything.
If one be on good terms with the Municipal Intendente
(Mayor) or the Comisario of Police (it is generally a
case of being friendly, if at all, with both and the other
members of the official clique; all usually to be found together
in the same bar or restaurant), the law looks very
indulgently on one, and at a pinch will turn a blind eye to
one’s, really only humorous, peccadillos. If not, one must
walk carefully like Agag until one has gathered common
sense enough to approach Authority in a properly friendly
(and acceptable) spirit.</p>

<p>Does the Comisario’s horse go lame, he will ask you to
lend him one. You do so, saying at the same time that you
have no further need of it. And the next time you have
trouble with your peons, or anyone else with less influence
than yourself, send for the Comisario, he will soon straighten
the matter out for you. Even if your trouble be with an
equal or superior in influence, smiling Authority will discover
a <i lang="la">modus vivendi</i> and drinks all round will seal the
friendly compact. It is seldom one meets anyone who is not
on good terms with his Authorities. Not to be so would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
remind one of the story of Carnot, who refused to stand in
with Napoleon I. The Emperor told him frankly that he
who was not with him was against him, and that he, Carnot,
was much too powerful a person with the people to be
permitted to be at large in France under the latter
condition. He must be exiled, and had better see Fouché
on the matter.</p>

<p>Carnot went; and, addressing Fouché, asked sternly,
“Where must I go? Traitor!” “Wherever you like.
Imbecile!” was Fouché’s cynical retort.</p>

<p>So, in Argentine rural ethics, if you are not friendly with
Authority you have only your own folly to thank for the
usually inconvenient consequences.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how much money Authority has to spend
on amusement when it gets a day or two’s holiday in Buenos
Aires; and it is great fun as well as good policy to go round
with him, if you also are in funds. Argentine Authority
seldom gives or expects anything for nothing; but usually
is a pleasant enough fellow withal, if taken the right way.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan, in such regards as in all others, is a less
sophisticated and, in country districts, a more primitively
minded person; though always hospitable, usually courteous
in his manner, and particularly so to strangers.</p>

<p>The most exalted Governmental spheres, those of the
National Governments in the Cities of Buenos Aires and
Montevideo, respectively, are nowadays almost entirely free
from any suggestion of the mildest form of even technical
corruption. It certainly is easier to obtain a personal interview
with the President or a Minister if one personally knows
one of his intimate friends or subordinate officials; but that
is all that influence really amounts to as regards any question
affecting overseas Commerce, Concessions or Foreign Affairs.
In regard to home politics, doubtless a good deal of intrigue
is constantly at work at Government House in Buenos Aires,
but those are matters which the foreign settler leaves exclusively
to the Argentines themselves. So long as they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
nothing which may affect trade or credit, even the representatives
of the largest foreign interests are careful to avoid
any act or word which might savour of interference in the
sole management by the Argentine of purely Argentine
affairs. As has been indicated elsewhere in these pages, such
interference is the one thing regarding which the Argentine
is very jealously suspicious. He may have framed most of
his Constitution on that of the United States, but he never
would have permitted the States or anyone else to do it for
him.</p>

<p>Apart from the transparent incorruptibility, from without,
at all events, of all members of the National Governments of
both Republics, there is a pleasant free-and-easiness about
the manner of Presidential and Ministerial receptions.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">salons</i> in which all-comers are received are large, airy
and well lighted; and are furnished with leather-covered
sofas, seated on which visitors wait their turn for the
President or Minister to grant them a few words of conversation;
during which his Excellency sits down on the
sofa beside them, cigarette in hand like everyone else in the
room.</p>

<p>At a longer, special, conference, coffee also is served, hot
in winter and iced in summer, even in the offices of subordinate
officials; and rumour has it that it is over this inexhaustible
supply of Nationally provided coffee and
cigarettes that internal politics are “made.” In Argentina
politics of this kind are kaleidoscopic; groups and individuals
forming fresh combinations and antagonisms too rapidly and
from too deeply underlying motives for anyone not profoundly
versed and continually engaged in the game to be
able to follow it with anything approaching comprehension.</p>

<p>Much of this has doubtless disappeared under the influence
of Dr. Saenz Peña; whose fearlessly honourable
nature judged, and judged rightly, that the National Government
of Argentina is now in a position to face without apprehension
any public opinion of its acts and policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally the spirit of intrigue, the love of which, almost
for itself, has roots deep down in Argentine human nature,
cannot yet be reckoned as dead; but it is certainly in the
course of being driven further and further away from the
centres of higher civilization by a superior ethical conception
of the duties of Government; even as the long-horned
native cattle have been ousted to frontier districts by the
appreciation by Estancieros of the incomparable advantages,
to themselves, of Shorthorns and Herefords.</p>

<p>In Uruguay there always has been much less tendency to
intrigue. There, a man was a Red or a White, a conscientious
supporter of the Rural or Urban party. While as for Finance
the Commercial Community has always and unswervingly
seen to it that its realm be kept clean and untarnished by
even the breath of scandal. It may here be objected that
now and again, foreign concessionaires have made bargains
with the National Government strangely profitable to themselves.
The true answer to such an observation would be
that in such cases the Government has invariably been the
quite innocent victim of greater experience and far-sightedness
in such matters than its own advisers had ever had
opportunity to attain.</p>

<p>Uruguayans would maintain the National credit by emptying
their own private pockets if need be and, in fact, have
expressed their intention of doing so on more than one
occasion when, as is mentioned in another chapter, the
Government allowed itself to be frightened into proposals
for issues of paper currency not founded on a strictly gold
basis. A proceeding which would have spelt repudiation of
a portion of the National liabilities; in the manner of the
Argentine “Conversion Law.”</p>

<p>The proof of the pudding is in the eating. And it is no
sign of bias to give Uruguay credit for plain facts which
incontrovertibly prove her sense of the sanctity of moral
as well as legal obligation.</p>

<p>True, she was never in quite such a financial tangle as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that in which Argentina found herself in 1891; but she
has often been poverty-stricken, and yet has always paid
to the utmost centesimo.</p>

<p>Generally, it may be said that a similar honesty prevails
in all branches of Government and fiscal affairs throughout
Uruguay.</p>

<p>For a glance at some small ways that are dark and tricks
that are vain, before these are entirely swept away, as they
now are being, before the healthy wind of moral improvement
(healthy even though, as some cynics assert, it has been
raised only by perception of the fact that in the long run,
honesty is the best policy) one must go to distant parts of
Argentina and there grope amid the intricacies of Provincial
and Municipal Administration. There, undoubtedly, we
may come across semi-obscure corners from which a highly
respectable chartered accountant would fly horror-stricken.
But we should also recognize that the whole small fabric of
intrigue and petty robbery is a Punchinello’s secret; well
known to and sympathetically approved by the whole surrounding
populace, whose attitude to the robber is that of
“Good luck to him! I should do the same if I had his
chance.” Of no use to endeavour to stir up public opinion
to demand the prosecution or dismissal of Authorities or
Officials who are perfectly well known to have been defrauding
the public for years.</p>

<p>Not a bit of it. You would only get for an answer, “What?
get rid of him now that he’s fat and get a lean one in his place
who would be far worse!” Meaning that a needy man
would steal more than a rich one. Local opinion would hold
that that way lay madness only; and the would-be reformer
would be merely regarded with pitying scorn.</p>

<p>No. The change is coming and coming rapidly with the
spirit of the age, and cannot be hastened in its inevitable
course; and this change will be thorough, for it will only
encounter the ineffectual opposition of a quite infantile dishonesty
which has never seriously tried to keep secret the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
practices which its vanity considered as so much evidence of
its own admirable cleverness.</p>

<p>Do you think the milk-can inspector did not delight in
telling that he had never seen a standard measure? Of
course he did; and a Municipal Intendente of a small country
town gets just as much pleasure from the knowledge that,
while ten men appear on his Municipality’s monthly wage-sheets
as road-menders, there are in fact only two and the
remaining eight receipts are signed, for a consideration, per
signature, by independent persons. A proceeding which, of
course, is perfectly well known to and indeed accepted as
immemorial custom by the general public. In these cases
no one ever gets caught; because those chiefly concerned
have always a pull in Provincial politics—otherwise they
would never have found themselves occupying the positions
they are in.</p>

<p>But, as the reader can see, all these are childish things;
already vanishing and soon to be completely put away by
the general and swift advance, moral as well as material,
of the Republic.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">MONTEVIDEO AND BUENOS AIRES</span></h2>

<p>Montevideo, the first discovered point of the
River Plate countries, is also the first stopping-place
for passenger boats from Europe; and if the
traveller from thence be in no immediate hurry to reach
Buenos Aires he might do much worse than spend, say a
week, in the clean, cool, pleasant capital of <span class="smcap">La Republica
de la Banda Oriental del Uruguay</span>.</p>

<p>Leaving his baggage to be sent for later, he will walk, or
take a convenient tram, from the harbour up the fairly steep
incline of a narrow street and find himself at a corner of the
ancient Plaza of the City; the Plaza with History represented
on two of its sides, to his right and left respectively,
by the Cathedral and the old Congress buildings. Facing
him, he will see modernity embodied in the palatial <span class="smcap">Club
Uruguayo</span>, while immediately on his left hand, at his back,
is a little front door and staircase leading to the comfortable
and hospitable English club.</p>

<p>The middle of the square is occupied by fine subtropical
and other plants surrounding a band-stand from which very
sweet music indeed proceeds at night in the summer-time;
which, including Spring and Autumn, lasts for nine months
of the year.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he will find his way to the Plaza Independencia
on one side of which is Government House, and almost behind
which is Montevideo’s Opera House, the Soler Theatre.
Later he can visit Pocitos, Ramirez and other delightful,
white-sanded bathing beaches, with which Montevideo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
abounds; for this city on a hill occupies a small peninsula
which juts out just where the estuary of the River merges
into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>All the streets leading from three sides of the old Plaza go
downhill to the sea; and up one parallel set or another of
them comes a fresh breeze at all times of the day and night
and at all seasons of the year. One seldom or never suffers
in Montevideo from the stifling oppression sometimes so
painful in the dog-days of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>With so many natural advantages, it can be readily understood
that Montevideo has an ambition and that that
ambition should be to become <em>the</em> seaside resort of South
America.</p>

<p>Towards the realization of this desire the Government
and the Municipality spare no expense at all
commensurate with their means. Fine broad motor drives
and promenades run, or are being constructed to run, all
round the three water-bound sides which, by the test of
school geographies, indicate a true peninsula.</p>

<p>Gaily striped bathing tents can be hired by the hour, day,
week or season on what have just been said to be delightful
soft, warm, sandy beaches. To come out of the water and
roll oneself dry in this fine clean sand is an experience not to
be missed and certainly to be remembered, apart from its
proclaimed virtues as a sovereign cure for rheumatism.</p>

<p>That malady must, however, surely be an imported article;
one does not naturally associate it with the bright dry
climate of Montevideo.</p>

<p>Municipal bands, good operatic and dramatic companies
are added lures for holiday-makers of the wealthier class
from neighbouring Republics; while Montevideo sustains
the ancient custom of keeping carnival, masked and with
illuminations, flower-throwing and costumed <i lang="es">corsos</i>, in a
fashion which entirely throws into the shade the now
moribund carnival of Buenos Aires.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus1">
<img src="images/illus1.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE PLAZA LIBERTAD, MONTEVIDEO</p>
</div>

<p>At Montevideo, all is done to please and nothing to annoy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
so that the throwing of water which was a leading feature of
the old-time carnival is now strictly prohibited by authority
enforced by the police; as is also the case in Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Thousands of people cross each year from Buenos Aires
for the Montevideo carnival, the whole available fleet of the
company which runs luxurious boats between the two cities
are pressed into the service of this occasion and become
floating hotels; the normal hotel accommodation of Montevideo
being insufficient to meet such an influx of visitors
during these few days.</p>

<p>By the way, the origin of this fine steamboat service is an
interesting example of the progress made by the two countries
and the fortunes which have been amassed in them during
existing lifetimes.</p>

<p>Before the building of the present dock system of Buenos
Aires, one of the boatmen who used to land and embark
passengers from or on the ocean-going ships was a man
named Nicolas Mihanovich; evidently a very level-headed
and at that time at least, a very frugal and saving person
indeed.</p>

<p>With his row-boat he gained sufficient to enable him to
purchase a sailing vessel which he used for regular traffic to
and fro across the broad mouth of the River Plate. So, his
enterprise grew; and only a very few years ago he turned
his own private company into a public one with larger aims,
in which latter company he nevertheless retains a very large
interest. The one-time boatman is now a multi-millionaire.
The present service leaves Buenos Aires, or Montevideo as
the case may be, at about ten o’clock each evening and
lands its passengers, after a good sleep in comfortable
beds, on the other side at about seven o’clock the following
morning.</p>

<p>Many are the true tales of fortunes amassed, sometimes
one may almost say won, in Argentina, especially, within
living memory.</p>

<p>Señor Santamarina, now deceased, left on his huge estate at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Tandíl, one of his many properties, the original two-wheeled
high cart which was his only fortune when he commenced
life as what in other countries would be called a transport
rider. This cart is, or till recently was, preserved in a glass
house erected specially by him to house and exhibit it to all
visitors to the estancia.</p>

<p>Another history is that of a millionaire family whose
immediate ancestor certainly won fortune by an astuteness
which may or may not be considered commendable.</p>

<p>He rented a large—large even for the Argentina of those
roomy days—tract of land from a man who foresaw wealth
in tree-planting. The latter was right; but his personal
calculations did not, as will be seen, turn out as he had
planned. He made it a condition that not less than a certain
number of trees should be planted on the land within the
period of the lease, and that for every tree above that
number planted he should, on the termination of the lease,
pay the sum of $1 to the outgoing tenant.</p>

<p>The wily lessee immediately set to work to plant trees as
fast as ever he could, and at the expiration of his lease
had millions of them, over and above the stipulated
number, to show for his pains. The unfortunate lessor could
not pay so many million dollars, and to end the affair was
glad to let his former lessee have full freehold possession of
the land and so call quits.</p>

<p>That land, still in the possession of the original lessee’s
family, is worth a huge fortune to-day, and its produce
represents a very large income indeed—forestry apart.</p>

<p>And now, as these stories have taken us to Argentina, the
reader may as well prepare to follow them by embarking on
one of the “Mihanovich” boats; as they still are and
probably always will be called, in spite of the longer name
of the new company, and find himself in Buenos Aires next
morning.</p>

<p>By leaving his baggage for further consideration, as he did
at Montevideo, he can go on foot in about five minutes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the landing-place across the gardens of the <span class="smcap">Paseo de Julio</span>,
which name is a first reminiscence of the birth of the Republic,
round one or the other side of the “Casa Rosada”
or pink-coloured Government House, and find himself
immediately in the Plaza Victoria with on his right the Stock
Exchange lying between the Calles 25 de Mayo and San
Martin—further reminiscences of the wars of Liberty.
Keeping his back towards the Casa Rosada, he will look
straight up the broad Avenida de Mayo with the historic old
<span class="smcap">Cabildo</span> or Town Hall on the left corner of the commencement
of the avenue and the fine new Municipality opposite.</p>

<p>At the far end of the avenue rises the splendid edifice of
the new Congress Building, the “Palace of Gold” as it is
called in quasi-humorous reference to its costliness. This
is, however, not a new joke. Formerly it was applied to the
Casa Rosada, now become a comparatively humble edifice.
Besides, if an Argentine calls one’s attention to the scandalous
cost of a public monument or building, it does not necessarily
mean that he is really so very angry about it. On the contrary,
it may well be that he is proud of belonging to a
Nation which can bravely bear such expenditure.</p>

<p>Under the Avenida de Mayo is the “tube” which runs
from the <span class="smcap">Once</span> station (which is situate on the western side
of the town and is the terminus of the Buenos Aires Western
Railway) to the Docks. The Once marks the point of departure
of the first six miles of Railway built on the River
Plate.</p>

<p>The new-comer will at once notice that the City of Buenos
Aires is laid out on the chessboard pattern with its streets
running North and South and East and West, a variation of
the pattern being now introduced by the new diagonal
avenues converging towards the Plaza Victoria, in course of
construction.</p>

<p>Along almost every street, except Calle Florida, the
Avenida de Mayo, and the diagonal avenues, runs a tramline
on which the cars all go in one direction in one street and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the contrary direction in the next and so on. Ten cents is
the fare for a single journey anywhere within the length or
breadth of the Federal Capital, but one cannot take tickets
entitling one to any change of car; and for that one must
buy another ten cents ticket.</p>

<p>This matter of change of car may have been overlooked by
the Municipality when the concession was granted to the
Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company, of which concession
the universal 10 cent fare was a <i lang="la">sine qua non</i> condition;
perhaps, on the other hand, the Company stuck out on that
point. Anyhow, if one wishes to get full value for his 10
cents on a Buenos Aires tramline he must stick to the car
in which he has begun his ride. By doing so, he can often
take a long round trip and come back to his point of departure.
This observation also applies to the Tramways in
Montevideo, but there, with due knowledge and careful
selection, one can practically get all over the place, without
changing; owing to the more erratic routes taken by the
lines.</p>

<p>For a variety of reasons, the Buenos Aires Tramway
system is considered by authorities on such matters to be
the best in the world. It is mostly in the hands of the Anglo-Argentine
Tramways Company.</p>

<p>Another company is the Lacroze, a private company
largely interested also in the Buenos Aires Central Railway.
Its trams run through the Capital and to the Western
suburban districts.</p>

<p>A third company runs trams out of the Capital to the
Southern Suburban districts.</p>

<p>It may here be said that a good supply of taxi-cabs is to
be found both in Montevideo and Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>One advantage, suggested by the mention of taxi-cabs, of
visiting Montevideo before Buenos Aires, is that that way
one feels richer after the journey between the two than one
would if the itinerary had been reversed.</p>

<p>Living is not cheap in Buenos Aires, but its cost is a relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
after a sojourn in the Uruguayan Capital; though expense
there is again as nothing if one has experienced that of Rio
de Janeiro, the dearest place, probably, in the whole world,
and the one in which, scenery apart, one gets as little satisfaction
for one’s money as anywhere.</p>

<p>In Montevideo one has, it is true, plenty of satisfaction of
a quiet, pleasant kind, but those (actually, although founded
on a firm gold basis) paper dollars—only four of them and
70 cents worth of mixed change for a British Sovereign—melt
quickly into inappreciable small silver and nickel;
none of which seems to be worth much, though a 50-cent bit
is really worth more than a British florin. For exchange
purposes that is; in its native land its purchasing power is
strikingly small. After Montevideo, there is some satisfaction
about the feel of the bundle of Argentine paper dollars
one gets for one’s Uruguayan money. And in Buenos Aires
several quite useful things can be got for $1, National (paper)
money. Although the purchasing power of this last (its
exchange value is 1s. 8¾d.) is not that of one shilling in
England.</p>

<p>In neither country does one often see an actual gold coin,
in Argentina practically never in ordinary everyday life;
most of the gold against which the current paper is issued
going, as will be seen in the Chapter on Finance and Commerce,
into the “Conversion” strong rooms and staying
there.</p>

<p>The passion for amusement must indeed be overpowering
in anyone who is not satisfied with what Buenos Aires provides
of all kinds in that regard. Two Opera Houses, the
older one, stately and comfortable in its interior arrangements,
and the new Municipal Opera House, the <span class="smcap">Colon</span>
Theatre, gorgeous in velvet and marble; and powdered,
gold-mace bearing lackeys to bow one in at its wide portals.</p>

<p>Great is the rivalry between these two houses to secure
the best stars and companies; and between them they
certainly get the best that Europe can provide. In some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
cases they have anticipated Europe, notably in the instances
of Caruso and Maria Gay, both of whom appeared in Buenos
Aires before Europe had even heard <em>of</em> them. One feature is
common to the policy of both Opera Houses, viz., a scale of
charges for admission so high that it is impossible for anyone
who wishes to be considered somebody not to have his or her
box at one or both of them for the season.</p>

<p>After the Opera House comes, in degree of prestige, perhaps,
the Odeon Theatre; most frequently devoted to the
representation of classic or serious drama. After it come
many theatres; the finest among them being the Coliseo in
which good companies, chiefly Italian, give first-rate performances
of every kind from Grand Guignol to Light
Opera. After these, again, come the purely Argentine
Theatres; in which drama and comedy faithfully reflecting
the true native life are performed.</p>

<p>Such performances should not be missed (as they too
often are because they are not fashionable in a country where
fashion’s favour is almost exclusively bestowed on imported
wares) by anyone having sufficient Argentine Spanish to
appreciate the purport and point of their dialogue; which,
in true Argentine fashion, includes a liberal use of words and
phrases capable of double meanings.</p>

<p>Brilliantly lighted, sumptuously panelled and upholstered
cafés with tables spreading over the pavement outside them,
tend to keep life in Buenos Aires awake till the wee sma’
hours begin to grow large.</p>

<p>“See Naples and die” runs the Neapolitan saying. “See
Buenos Aires and stop there as long as you can” is likely to
prove acceptable advice to anyone with a taste for easy
gaiety and with a disposition for not doing to-day anything
of an irksome or disagreeable nature which can possibly be
put off till the morrow. Much native encouragement will be
afforded him to postpone it till the Greek Kalends; and then
to change his mind about doing it at all.</p>

</div>

<p>Till the morrow’s sun shines, that is. Then he will see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
City, which overnight he may have thought wholly absorbed
by pleasure-seeking, transformed into a quick-moving, alert
commercial centre. Surely the Argentine when in Buenos
Aires burns his candle at both ends. The well-to-do have,
however, their Estancias on which to vary town life with
mentally restful, if often physically laborious, days spent in
superintending their agricultural interests.</p>

<p>Fine-looking new buildings are ever springing up in
Buenos Aires with such surprising suddenness and rapidity
as to render any description of the chief edifices of that city
out of date almost before it can get into print. Even the
palatial home of the Jockey Club, renowned as the most
splendidly luxurious Club House in the world, is soon to be
abandoned by its members for another more gorgeously
wonderful still.</p>

<p>One leaves the City for a few weeks in the <i lang="es">Camp</i> wondering
what the former will look like on one’s return.</p>

<p>That is one did, until very recently. Just now, the War
has called a temporary halt in the commencement of many
projected building operations.</p>

<p>One cannot, however, leave Buenos Aires without mention
of the beautiful, park-like suburb of Palermo; with the
broad Avenida de Alvear leading from the northern part of
the City to it. It may here be observed that fashion has not
travelled westward in Buenos Aires; the Northern parts of
the City being the most fashionable and adorned with the
most palatial new dwellings.</p>

<p>A wide palm-bordered avenue leads to others winding
round grassy spaces in which backwaters of the Tigre River
glint under overhanging trees; amid all of which is a great
restaurant, after the fashion of those in the Parisian Bois de
Boulogne.</p>

<p>That restaurant is, to the author’s mind, the one great
tawdry blot on the picture; but it is only fair to add that
every afternoon and evening, during a long season, it is
crowded with gaily dressed people who all seem happy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
vociferously contented with the refreshments and music it
provides.</p>

<p>The Palermo Avenue is the fashionable drive, the Corso of
the Élite of Buenos Aires Society; and also of others
desirous of attracting attention to their equipages and themselves.
Everyone the aspirant to social distinction ought—and
ought not—to know is to be seen at Palermo on a fine
late afternoon or evening in Spring. In Summer most of
them are, naturally, at Mar-del-Plata.</p>

<p>Adjoining the Park is the Palermo race-course, over which
the Jockey Club rules absolute. It should be added that the
Buenos Aires Jockey Club is not only an association of racing
men, but is in reality the hub of social intercourse in Buenos
Aires.</p>

<p>Its large and small dining-rooms are available to members,
and even to very distinguished strangers, for private dinners;
which are exquisitely cooked and served by the numerous
and highly expert staff of the Club.</p>

<p>In fact the Jockey Club is a very influential body indeed;
quite apart from racing matters.</p>

<p>There can be no manner of doubt that the gambling
element in racing is far too popular in Buenos Aires. There
is a race meeting on every day in the week, Sundays, of
course, included, during a season which lasts nearly all the
year round. And these meetings are thronged by youths
and other people who most certainly should be, and would
much better be, at work.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the system of weekly
National Lotteries (these are at least carried on with unimpeachable
fairness and 10% of the amounts subscribed
to them, in payment for tickets, goes, after paying working
expenses, printing, etc., to charity) the totalizer appeals far
too sympathetically to the Latin-American natural love of
gambling; and that love, as always in a new country where
so many fortunes seem to have had their origin in luck, has
developed dangerously on the right bank of the River Plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Close also to Palermo Park is the scene of the annual
Agricultural and Live Stock Show; now a world-renowned
Exhibition of as fine cattle and sheep as can be seen anywhere.
Horses and Poultry also are splendidly represented
at this show; which is perhaps the greatest event in the
Argentine Calendar.</p>

<p>Further out from the city, past and beyond Palermo, is
Hurlingham; an ever-enlarging group of English red-brick
villas inhabited for the most part by English people. These
villas surround the ample grounds of the Hurlingham Club,
where polo and riding and driving competitions, etc., follow
the lines of its English prototype. The Club house is comfortable,
the food good, and a huge swimming bath is among
its many undoubted attractions. It also has a drag hunt.</p>

<p>Further out again are beautiful reaches of the Tigre River,
famous for boating; and on which an annual regatta, the
Henley of South America, is held.</p>

<p>The Avenida de Alvear, above referred to, runs through
the most fashionable residential quarter of Buenos Aires, a
quarter filled with veritable huge palaces which with their
gardens surround the Recoleta, the fashionable cemetery.
A strange city of the dead in which the coffins are seen on
shelves contained in small plate-glass fronted temples, so
that all may view the last outward casings of generations.</p>

<p>On “The Day of the Dead” (All Saints’ Day) the Recoleta
is a blaze of beautiful wreaths and floral tributes; afterwards
too often replaced, alas, by ugly contrivances in
porcelain or, worse still, enamelled iron.</p>

<p>Returning to Buenos Aires proper one must not, cannot,
forget <span class="smcap">Calle Florida</span>, “The Bond Street of the South.”
So called because in it are situate most of the finest shops in
South America for the sale of what are sometimes officially
described as articles of luxury; wearing apparel of the best
and costliest, for both sexes, jewellery, stationery, etc. It is,
in fact, to Buenos Aires all Bond Street once was, and old
Bond Street to some extent still is, to London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Needless, almost, to say, Florida deals exclusively in imported
goods and a very great majority of its shopkeepers
are foreigners; among whom the purveyors of “Modes,”
“Robes” and “Lingerie” are, naturally, mostly French.</p>

<p>No vehicular traffic whatever is now allowed in Calle
Florida between certain hours of the afternoon; in order
not to incommode the throngs of fashionable shoppers with
whom it is usually crowded. It is the only street in which
Argentine ladies of high degree are to be seen on foot. In
bygone and less crowded times it was the scene of the afternoon
Corso; when play was made with fans and gallants
ogled from the edges of the pavement.</p>

<p>There is at present still a lack of Hotel accommodation
suitable for Europeans of moderate means. There are great
numbers of Hotels in Buenos Aires, but the good ones are
very expensive while the cheaper ones are not very good.
That is to say, one must have got accustomed to the South
American haphazard fashion of service and general arrangements
before being able to regard the latter as in any way
comfortable. Montevideo is still worse off; having few
Hotels which can be regarded as good (though there are one
or two), while prices, as in everything else, run higher than
in Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>A word must be said in defence of the latter City against a
prevailing impression, created, goodness knows how, of its
intense immorality. This charge simply is not true. Buenos
Aires is no more immoral than and certainly not as vicious
as are most European Capitals.</p>

<p>True, it is not in South American human nature to be
puritanical but the lower classes in Argentina and Uruguay
are but non-moral, to use a somewhat fashionable term, with
the non-morality of grown-up children, which they are.
They have not the faintest idea of the vice which abounds in
the great cities of the Northern Hemisphere. Montevideo is
more staid than cosmopolitan Buenos Aires; even at
Carnival time the former City seems to take its merrymaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
seriously. Any real vice which can be found in
either Capital is an imported article.</p>

<p>If among the lower classes of both countries the whole
advantages of the marriage ceremony seem not to be duly
appreciated, this is due, in the vast majority of cases, to
motives of economy. A religious marriage service is a costly
item in the equipment of a young couple, and a purely civil
ceremony is even less favourably looked on by neighbours
than a postponement of any ceremony at all. Later, such
couples usually do marry with due pomp and circumstance,
including the invitation of all and sundry to the humble
wedding feast. After that, all is in order in the case of the
death of the husband and father; for marriage legitimatizes
previously born children. Indeed, the writer was once
present at a <i lang="es">fiesta</i> in a rural district, not forty minutes’ run
by train from the City of Buenos Aires, organized to honour
the occasion of the visit of a Priest who in a very short space
of time married the parents and christened a whole batch of
their children.</p>

<p>An old custom still chiefly prevailing among the humbler
classes, both urban and rural, is one which may be called the
“waking” of the dead. The news of a bereavement spreads
quickly among neighbours; who do not wait to be invited
but arrive, in groups organized extemporaneously by themselves,
at the house of mourning. There, one of such groups
succeeds another, and so on throughout the night after a
death; sitting silently and only moving to partake of the
necessary refreshment provided in view of their sure coming.</p>

<p>As in most other countries where modernity has not yet
suppressed all local colour with its neutral tints, the lower
classes in both Argentina and Uruguay are much the most
interesting. The free-and-easy Bohemian sort of life in a
<i lang="es">conventillo</i><a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> is curious. In each of its many rooms lives a
family, while the court is common to all for cooking (a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
charcoal brazier usually stands at the side of each door),
washing of clothes and, last but not least, the discussion of
<i lang="es">mate</i> and gossip. All sorts of people dwell in a single conventillo,
artisans, hawkers, washerwomen, milliners, factory
hands, poor employees, etc. etc., and all group themselves
in the common courtyard of an evening when work is done,
frequently to the music of a guitar.</p>

<p>The upper classes, on the other hand, strive chiefly to reflect
the latest moods of European fashion in general and of that
of Paris in particular—even, since the War, to the extent
of making retrenchment in living expenses the fashion. A
fashion which, if it last, will not be the least of the good
which has come to Argentina from the European upheaval
which has forced the River Plate countries to learn to rely
on their own resources and individual efforts. Gone,
already, are the battalions of motor-cars of very latest
pattern with which every wealthy Argentine family has
hitherto thought it necessary to its dignity to be provided—one
each for father, mother and each son and daughter—economy
is now “De Moda” and ostentation therefore
become old-fashioned and bad taste. An immense change to
have taken place, as it did, in the course of only a few
months.</p>

<p>Montevideo had no need of such a <i lang="fr">volte face</i> of habit.
Uruguayans never developed the love of display so characteristic
of Argentine aristocracy.</p>

<p>With its some 1½ million inhabitants, Buenos Aires has
the largest population of any Capital City in America.
Montevideo, with some 400,000 inhabitants, surpasses
Washington in this respect.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">FINANCE AND COMMERCE</span></h2>

<p>Owing to their dependence on the Northern Hemisphere
for the Capital necessary for the continuance
of their development, the River Plate countries,
and South American countries generally, are as a barometer,
and an extremely sensitive one, in regard to the conditions
of the Money markets of the Older World.</p>

<p>Thus already in 1913, the fear of Balkan complications in
both Argentina and Uruguay was represented by a general
fall in what previously may have been somewhat inflated,
or at least too anticipatory, land values.</p>

<p>This fall, coupled with and increased by relatively bad
harvests, marked the commencement of rather bad times in
both Republics. In this regard it may be well to say that
comparatively bad times come easily and swiftly on a
country like Argentina, the prosperity of which depends
very largely indeed on its cereal production and in which
landowners and agriculturists from the largest <i lang="es">Estanciero</i> to
the smallest <i lang="es">Chacrero</i> have long been encouraged by Nature
to regard each coming year as inevitably more prosperous
than its predecessor. The result of this optimism, usually
justified by the event, is that when any set-back, caused,
say, by late frosts or early rains, such as farmers in less
favoured lands would take as an ordinary risk of their
occupation, does occur, the streets of Buenos Aires are
immediately filled with men with long faces running to the
Banks and anxiously discussing the ruin which, apparently,
seems to them to be staring them in the face, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that most of them must often have been through
similar “crises” before.</p>

<p>One need only go “on ’Change” to be almost convinced
that the whole vaunted prosperity of the Republic is tumbling
about its ears. Even newspapers, which, by this time
at least, ought to know better, join in the panic cry.</p>

<p>At such times people possessed of Capital and common
sense make good investments; the Banks tide everyone
else over quite comfortably enough not to interfere with
the socially obligatory summer gathering at Mar-del-Plata;
the following harvest is a bumper; and all is well again in
the best and sunniest of all possible Republics.</p>

<p>That is the usual course of happenings after inferior
harvests but, as is easy to imagine, the present situation is
as unique in South America as it is in all other parts of the
world. On the River Plate, indeed, it was, if one may be
permitted the expression, aggravated by anticipation consequent
on the (almost miraculous for these countries)
following of yet another rainy harvest-time.</p>

<p>On the top of all came August with its declarations of
European War, the first result of which in the River Plate
Republics was intimate realization of the extent to which
they had been dependent on Europe since the commencement
of their real commercial development.</p>

<p>They were thrown entirely on their own resources and
ability with no chance of any immediate help from outside.</p>

<p>It is to the credit of both Republics that they rose to the
situation. Seven days of Bank Holiday were at once proclaimed
in Argentina; during which time the Ministry of
Finance and other Government departments were loyally
assisted by both native and foreign bankers and financiers
to devise necessary measures.</p>

<p>In the result Laws were summarily passed by Congress to
prevent all exportation of gold; outgoing ships might only
take with them sufficient coal to last them till they reached
<em>the next port in South America</em> (Argentina and Uruguay as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
yet produce no practically valuable coal, so that they are
dependent on import for their stocks of this fuel), and provision
was made that cereal exports should be limited to the
surplus of such produce after the retention of a liberal
allowance for home consumption until the next harvests.</p>

<p>Uruguay adopted similar protective measures.</p>

<p>So far so good, but the Argentine Banks, generally, were
faced with the necessity for immediate decision under
conditions which, unfortunately, are all too frequently
recurrent in rapidly progressing countries. Many of the
securities held by them were obviously not worth the value
that they had been taken for, in consequence of the previous
shrinkage of values above alluded to.</p>

<p>This was a momentous matter for consideration during
the seven days’ Bank holiday.</p>

<p>In the result, all Banks adopted the policy of cutting
losses even at the risk, amounting to extreme likelihood, of
letting their weaker customers drown,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> while mercy was only
extended to those evidently strong enough to keep afloat
throughout the crisis and its after effects.</p>

<p>This decision taken, and enforced on the reopening of
the Banks, scarcely any credit establishment took any
advantage of the Moratorium declared by the Government.</p>

<p>In Uruguay the situation proved easier on account of a
comparative absence of the complication of securities based
on inflated values. Here again the Uruguayan showed his
superiority in the matter of cautiously prudent finance over
his more enthusiastically volatile over-river cousin.</p>

<p>This observation notwithstanding, it is now clear that
although a severe financial pinch is still felt in both countries,
the Argentine and Uruguayan ships of State are both fully
trimmed to enable them to ride over bad financial weather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the first shock of which was the most perilous to meet and
needed the most prompt and intelligent handling.</p>

<p>In the result neither country will eventually be any worse
for the moral effects of having suddenly been left to its own
resources.</p>

<p>Meanwhile land, especially, perhaps, in Argentina, offers
an opportunity to Capital such as, as has been said elsewhere
in these pages, everyone for humanitarian reasons must
hope will never occur again.</p>

<p>Given knowledge of just where and what to buy, large
fortunes await those with courage and capital to purchase
either town lots or agricultural and pastoral land in either
Republic; in Argentina preferably for earlier realization.</p>

<p>Once peace is declared, and even before, it needs little
imagination to perceive the wealth to be secured by the
agricultural and live-stock produce on markets suddenly
deprived of much of the usual output of sources of cereal
supply as Russia and Canada, through withdrawal of labour
for military purposes, and faced with an enormously increased
demand for meat and grain caused by the necessary
shortage of production over all War-infected areas.</p>

<p>In fact Argentina and Uruguay are likely soon to experience
the truth of the proverb, “It’s an ill wind that blows
nobody any good,” and they are among the very few
countries of the world about the commercial conditions of
which, after the war, it is pretty safe to prophesy in the
direction of a prompt return, in an enhanced degree, to their
normal course of ever-growing prosperity.</p>

<p>Always with the factor of population and consequent sufficiency
of agricultural labour being reserved for consideration
after the event. A large and very serious reservation which
cannot safely be lost sight of by anyone desirous of land speculation
in either of the two countries under discussion.</p>

<p>Let the reader pardon this recurrent insistence on this
question of population, made in the hope that it may help
to open the eyes of the Authorities concerned, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Argentine, to the crying necessity in their country’s interests
for practically workable inducements to true colonization,
as distinguished from mere partial exploitation of necessitous
wage-earners. And the eyes not only of the Authorities, but
of everyone having a pecuniary interest of any sort in either
Republic, so that their Congresses and landowners may be
forced to consider the question in the liberal and enlightened
spirit which alone can remove the greatest menace to their
country’s economic progress.</p>

<p>If the two Governments and great landowners would only
devote one-tenth part of the admirable ingenuity and energy
with which they, and the Argentine especially, have very
successfully combated locust invasions to the attraction of
small-holding proprietary agriculturalists, the River Plate
Territories would soon break into an irruption of statues of
the originators of such measures which would outrival the
vast quantity of those erected to the memories of Generals
San Martin, Artígas and Urquíza. (One could travel far in
Argentina without discovering a town which does not
possess a statue of the first-named deliverer of his country.
Uruguay has also many San Martin statues, but runs
preferably, as is natural, to Urquíza and, lately, in consequence
of the whitewashing efforts of modern historians,
Artígas.)</p>

<p>In view of the actual situation, financial and commercial
statistics relating to the ante-war era necessarily seem to
savour mustily of the back-number. This savour is, however,
more due to imagination than to actual fact, since such
statistics are just as interesting as ever they were and
really show the normal trend of things economic to be
resumed and likely to be followed in even a more favourable
course, as far at least as Export is concerned. As for the
Import of manufactured goods an attempt to deal with
some of the probabilities or possibilities of this question in
its future aspects is made later in this chapter.</p>

<h3>CURRENCY</h3>

<p>The “Caja de Conversión” (A term for which “Conversion
Chest” is the usual clumsy translation, though “Conversion
Box” stands as a triumph of the translator’s art. Perhaps
“Conversion Office” sounds best, though it does not convey
a true idea of vaults filled with sacks of golden coin and
therefore “Conversion Bank” is here preferred) is an
Argentine Government Institution under the control of the
National Ministry of Finance created for the purpose of
dealing with the issue, exchange, and conversion of the
currency of the country. It issues the paper currency and
must hold in reserve sufficient gold to meet the circulating
paper money; it also mints the nickel and copper coinage
of the country.</p>

<p>Under the Conversion Law a fixed ratio was assigned as
between gold and paper. A paper dollar, instead of being
theoretically equivalent in value to a gold dollar, was
declared to be worth only 44 cents gold; thus with 44 cents
gold as the fixed equivalent of one dollar paper and, conversely,
2·27 paper dollars that of one dollar gold, and the
smallest gold coin minted the equivalent of 2½ dollars gold,
the use of paper in all the odd amounts of everyday transactions
is inevitable and consequently the major portion of
the gold which reaches the country is forced by the public
need of the more convenient currency into the “Caja de
Conversión.”</p>

<p>The accumulation of gold in the “Caja” on December
31st, 1915, was well over 61 millions sterling, and it must
be noted that these accumulations cannot leave the “Caja”
under any consideration (unless by special sanction of
Congress), except in exchange for paper currency, until the
time when the currency shall be placed on a logically
complete metallic basis. The provisions of the Conversion
Law in this regard are exceptionally stringent; under them
every official of the “Caja,” from the highest to the lowest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
is personally responsible for their observance, and they
cannot be overruled by any power in the land. So, until
Congress approves what is commonly referred to as the
conversion, the store of gold in the “Caja” will continue
practically intact and will increase.</p>

<p>The misuse of this term “Conversion” has given rise to
much confusion of ideas, even in Argentina. The actual
conversion took place with the above-mentioned assignment
of the fixed ratio of value between gold and paper.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the present is not the moment for the
change in the form of the currency, but it should be added
that apart from the immediate effects of the war the time
for that change has not yet arrived. Irresponsible projects
for the change have been put forward from time to time
during recent years, but official declarations in that regard
have never yet gone further than complacent platitudes to
the effect that the time for it was fast approaching; without,
however, the faintest indications of any schemes for carrying
the change out in practice. Besides, under the Law it cannot
be accomplished until a fund or deposit in the Bank of the
Nation, and to which the National Government makes
contributions out of revenue, has reached the amount
necessary to form a reserve against the paper currency in
circulation prior to the passing of the Conversion Law.
For a long while past, the amount of that fund stood at six
millions sterling, but this amount (then still insufficient for
such reserve) became reduced in August last to two millions
sterling in consequence of special financial measures adopted
by the Argentine Government at the outbreak of the war
and referred to more fully in the chapter on “The War.”</p>

<p>On the 31st of December, 1914, the Argentine Government
held gold accumulations to the value in round figures of
63 millions sterling, of which, as has been seen, 2 millions
pertain to the Conversion Fund at the Bank of the Nation.
This fund must not be confused with the amounts in the
“Caja,” the uses of the former (apart from its constituting, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
has been said, a reserve against the paper currency in circulation
previously to the passing of the Conversion Law)
being limited to the purposes of foreign exchange, the
benefit of the Fund itself and to aid the control of the
market; while the accumulations in the “Caja” can only,
in normal circumstances, leave it in exchange for paper
currency.</p>

<p>Besides the actual gold in the “Caja” this Institution
held at the end of 1915 gold and bonds to the value of
over 14 millions sterling which had been deposited at the
various Argentine Legations. These deposits have naturally
increased largely since. Besides all this the Bank of the
Nation, the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires and the
private banks held large amounts of gold.</p>

<p>Uruguay has not introduced, and has always resisted
the temptation to introduce, any such complications of her
currency; which is on a thorough gold basis.</p>

<p>The Argentine Conversion Law was passed in 1899 and
abrogated in 1901-2 by Congress (in consequence of the
anticipation of possible war with Chile, over the frontier
question, the payment by the Nation of Provincial debts and
the closing of Argentine ports because of an outbreak of
bubonic plague).</p>

<p>Therefore the present solid financial status of the Argentine
Republic dates from only twelve, or, on the most liberal
reckoning, fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>Uruguay’s first surplus (of $453,110) accrued in 1905-6;
though an increased surplus has figured in each Uruguayan
National Budget since that date.</p>

<h3>THE ARGENTINE MONETARY SYSTEM</h3>

<p class="noindent">Is controlled by the Conversion law, above referred to, which
fixed a ratio between the value of the paper and gold
currencies and made these interchangeable at that ratio until
the time should be judged to have arrived for the substitution
of metallic coinage for paper.</p>

<p>The law was passed as the only available though drastic
remedy for the state of financial chaos, nothing less, in
which Argentina found herself for some years after the
crisis of 1891. For the coming of this chaos Argentines
blame the European Bankers who, at least, looked on
whilst the country floundered into it. For this view they
have considerable reason. The Bankers were men of great
experience in Finance; of which the Argentines of that
day had little or none. Argentina relied on the men who
had taken her Finances in hand for the development of her
vast natural resources. She awoke to find herself in a
financial condition which would have spelt a century of ruin
to any less nature-favoured land. And it was an Argentine,
Señor Ricardo Pillado, now Director-General of the Division
of Commerce and Industry in the Ministry of Agriculture,
who devised the Law which, though it in effect involved a
partial repudiation of the country’s liabilities, at any rate
made possible the financial renaissance on which her present
great prosperity was founded.</p>

<p>As has been seen, the Conversion Law said that a paper
dollar should be equivalent to 44 cents gold and that conversely
a gold dollar should be worth 2·27 paper dollars.
This ratio was supposed to have been fixed by taking the
average ratio of value between paper and gold over a certain
period immediately prior to the passing of the Law.</p>

<p>This basis is now believed to have been fictitious, it being
found that, had such an average of values been struck, a
paper dollar would have become the equivalent to something
much more like 60 cents gold. So that in fact a repudiation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of 40 cents liability on every paper dollar in circulation was
made to become one of 56 cents.</p>

<p>That, however, is past history; and the existing Law
appears likely to remain in operation for an indefinite time
to come.</p>

<p>It has its inconveniences. Institutions and traders are
obliged by Law to keep their books in both currencies.
There is no gold coin available as an equivalent to 1 paper
dollar. One needs to have a clear 50 dollars’ worth of notes
before one can get gold out of the Conversion Bank; so that
all transactions involving odd amounts must be carried
through with the aid of paper. In point of fact gold is only
seen in the course of important transactions. Still, the gold
is there, in the country, in the Conversion Bank; and
cannot be withdrawn from the coffers of that Institution
except as against paper dollars, nor can paper dollars be
issued except as against gold actually in the Conversion
Bank. For the absolutely strict observance of these rules
everyone concerned, from the President of the Republic
down to the humblest employee of the Caja is personally
responsible under the law. By the operation of the law the
Republic holds a usually ever-increasing stock of gold; the
accumulation of which is aided by the inconvenience for
practical exchange of the figures ·44 and 2·27.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that the object which the framers
of the Conversion Law originally had in view, the rehabilitation
of the country’s Finance and credit, has been fulfilled
long ago; and it is for other reasons that Foreign Capitalists
and Banks, to whom Argentina must still look for the means
of her fuller development, prefer to let the dual monetary
system, with its several practical inconveniences, continue
instead of encouraging Congress to declare the purpose of
the Law fulfilled, by which declaration it would, by its terms,
lapse <i lang="la">ipso facto</i>. On that happening there would be a period,
momentary only, in all probability, but still a period, during
which the coffers of the Conversion Bank would be open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
through the automatic lapse of the Law of its creation. And
Capitalists and Bankers, grown very prudent indeed in their
generation, prefer that those coffers should remain closed and
safeguarded as they are; even at the cost of some few extra
clerks to cope with a system which otherwise works very
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Shin-plasters, as the paper dollars are called by Anglo-Argentines,
fulfil all the purposes of daily life as well as
would silver or other metallic tokens. Paper dollars,
guaranteed by gold, have also other advantages over a
metal coinage which might not be so fully guaranteed.</p>

<p>Therefore the Conversion Law remains a live letter on the
Argentine Statute Book.</p>

<p>It is, however, a vulgar error to refer to the time when
other tokens might be substituted for paper as the time for
“Conversion.” Conversion really took place with the
coming into operation of the law which converted a fluctuating
ratio into a fixed one.</p>

<p>The speculation in gold, referred to elsewhere, which had
attained disastrous dimensions just prior to the passing of
the Law, was another evil to which that Law put an end.
Then as now all everyday transactions were carried out in
paper; but, then, no man could tell from hour to hour what
the paper he held was worth. Everyone was by force of
circumstances practically a gambler whether he wished to
be one or not. The paper tokens for which he had sold his
wares one day might be worth much more or less the next.
Everyone had to make his own forecast of probabilities before
he could make or give a price for anything; and therefore
became a constant speculator, a gambler in futures, in fact.
The bad moral effects of such a state of things is obvious.
Many other financial evils were rife at this time, which now
have only historic interest, among them may be mentioned
the Banks of Issue for which authority appears practically
to have been given by the State to anyone able to procure
and furnish offices. Stacks of the notes of these precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Institutions still occupy space as curious lumber somewhere
in the cellars and garrets of Government House. Valueless
and best forgotten by a prosperous and enlightened nation
which no longer needs any such awful examples to deter it
from lapse into irregular finance.</p>

<p>Uruguay has a gold, silver and nickel coinage, but, as in
Argentina, notes are the most common tokens, especially for
amounts of $1 and upwards. As will have been understood,
Uruguay has no Caja de Conversión, her currency being and
always having been on a direct gold basis.</p>

<h3>COMMERCIAL CONDITIONS</h3>

<p>One of the immediately world-wide effects of the great
War has been the practically total elimination of German
trade competition, an elimination which may not unreasonably
be calculated to last for some time to come.</p>

<p>This therefore is the golden opportunity for other competitors
to capture the large bulk of export trade which had
gradually been absorbed and was in course of constantly
increasing absorption in the countries under discussion by
German firms.</p>

<p>Many Consular Reports and publications of the “Bureau
of American Republics” have respectively dealt with the
consequent loss of trade to Great Britain and the comparatively
slow advance in that respect made by the United
States and these documents have insistently pointed out
the whys and wherefores of German commercial success
over their chief rivals.</p>

<p>The writer cannot therefore lay claim to originality in the
present observations, but does claim that his persistence in
the reiteration of what he, and many greater than he, have
continually urged on every possible occasion during the past
decade has been and is in what appears to him to be the
best interests of those most concerned.</p>

<p>Of the two nations the British still has the better opportunity
to extend its commerce in both Argentina and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Uruguay. The reasons (apart from the actual kaleidoscopic
financial and industrial situation) for this opinion are that
the English (as all people hailing from the British Isles
are commonly called in South America) have already
acquired in both countries a firm reputation for straightforward
dealing, founded on many years’ experience and
untainted by any suspicion of underlying political motives,
whereas the South American Republics generally harbour a
latent but constant resentment of what they rightly or
wrongly consider to be the tendency of the United States to
assume a dominating influence over both Americas. In fact
to construe the Monroe doctrine as meaning, to cite the catch-phrase
which to the innermost South American mind embodies
something very closely resembling an unpleasant
truth, “America for the <em>North</em> Americans.”</p>

<p>Therefore, pushing United States’ commerce is immediately
met by a seemingly dull indifference to the merits of
the wares it offers, praise it those wares never so loudly.
And this observation suggests another of almost equal truth
and importance, viz. that the loud and strenuous vaunting
of an article and the <em>hustling</em> methods so much admired in
the great Republic of the North are worse than useless in
Spanish South America. “Why so much talk and so much
hurry to strike a bargain if the thing is really good?” is the
mental attitude of the average Spanish American towards
the vociferous North American traveller who usually makes
the further mistake of appearing to wish to teach his listener
the latter’s own business. This, as has been said elsewhere in
these pages, is a thing no Argentine or Uruguayan will stand.
No one is a more severe critic of himself, his methods and
Institutions, no one is most enamoured of progress and
improvement than he. But <em>he</em> must be the discoverer and
chooser of the remedies for his own defects, <em>he</em> and he alone
must be the arbiter of his own destinies and set his own house
in order. In such matters he will brook no interference.
And least of all from the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>It is surprising that the commercial ability of the latter
country should not long ago have discovered and acted in
harmony with this feature of South American psychology.
It seems, however, to have escaped appreciation by “Yankee”
cuteness.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we find, in the present writer’s opinion, two
existing obstacles (apart, as has been indicated above, from
the present financial situation) to the extension of the trade
of the United States in Argentina and Uruguay. One of
these, the inappropriate method of approach usually pursued
by travellers and the other a strong and jealous suspicion
of the ulterior motives of the United States in endeavouring
to strengthen her commercial foothold in the Southern
Hemisphere. The first of these obstacles should be easily
removable, unless, indeed, it be too firmly rooted in the
North American mentality. The second is a matter for
extremely delicate state diplomacy, and equally delicate
behaviour of the United States’ delegates at each future
“Congress of American Republics.”</p>

<p>Having thus glanced at seemingly obvious defects in
United States methods we may turn to those of British
manufacturers.</p>

<p>In their regard one can scarcely restrain the question,
“Do they really want the South American trade at all?”
Because, if they do, they set about getting it in the strangest
possible ways. Their apparent attitude can be summed up
by saying that they point-blank refuse to give a customer
what he thinks he wants unless his ideas on that subject
entirely coincide with what they think is best for themselves
and, incidentally, it would seem, for him.</p>

<p>South American governments insist on the metrical
system of weights and measures for Customs purposes: the
British manufacturer persists in a firm refusal to contemplate
anything but British Tons and Feet. This may seem
a trifling matter to anyone not engaged in the Import trade
of a metrical-system country, but in practice the rendering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of British weights and measures into their metrical equivalents
involves not only a large amount of clerical labour, but
is also a frequent source of error in the results.</p>

<p>A most actively patriotic Briton who is the head of a large
Importing firm in Montevideo told the present writer not
long ago that in spite of his patriotism he had been driven to
deal with German firms because, for one reason, of the
constant inflictions on him of $80 fines by the Customs
Authorities, that sum being the statutory fine in Uruguay
for any misstatement of weight or bulk on a declaration.</p>

<p>He, in common with the generality of Importers in Argentina
or Uruguay, had found himself confronted by several
very weighty reasons for necessarily transferring the bulk of
his orders from British to German firms, the chief of which
was that above summed up; namely, that British manufacturers
would not adapt themselves to his customers’
requirements.</p>

<p>“We are making this, that, or the other pattern” of whatever
the article in question may be, and “if you don’t like
that you must go elsewhere” is the gist of the average
British manufacturer’s last word in the discussion. And, as
the Importer is not running a Commercial Museum of articles
of the highest quality or best British taste, but has to sell
what he imports to customers who have lamentably independent
ideas of what they want, he does go elsewhere, that
is to say he did, and, most frequently, to Germany. To
Germany, where most things were at all events cheaper, and
where, if qualities were not so good as in the United Kingdom,
manufacturers were adaptable, and their travelling
representatives spoke Spanish and understood the ways and
wishes and even the foibles of South American customers.</p>

<p>As a rule, commercial travellers from either Great Britain
or the United States do not speak anything like fluent
Spanish. Therefore, they are obliged to engage interpreters
to accompany them on their business calls, while they were
quite unable to take advantage of the opportunities sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
for by their Spanish-speaking German competitors of
mingling in the semi-social life of their customers. In the
bar or restaurant the German traveller was a jolly good
fellow always ready to pay his share of the wine bill and with
his pockets filled with more than passable cigars and he could
enjoy and respond to the local humour and generally take part
in all the fun of a jovial evening-out; for which the Argentine,
especially, is always ready and willing to find an excuse.</p>

<p>Now, doing persuasive business through an interpreter is
by no means an invariably satisfactory proceeding, because
the interpreter’s own mentality inevitably intervenes and
unconsciously colours both sides of the argument with tinges
of his own individuality. He says what <em>he</em> thinks you wish
to say, and often enough replies with the best rendering he
can make, not always an entirely accurate one, of what he
conceives to be the meaning of the other party to the discussion.
As for the evening-out! One has only to imagine
the effects of a laborious translation of always very allusive
wit; the point of which in Argentina most frequently hinges
on double-meaning.</p>

<p>The German studied the language, and, as far as he could,
the tastes and ways of the people of the country he intended
visiting before he set out on his commercial travels.</p>

<p>Travellers of other nationalities should do likewise if they
wish to secure a substantial share of the trade now left open
to their bidding.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>And British manufacturers, if so be that (I repeat the
question) they do want the South American markets for their
goods, must make up their minds to suit the requirements of
those markets whatever may be their own private opinion of
South American tastes and ways. They must still remember
that although German competition has ceased and may continue
non-existent for even a very long time to come, and
while Belgium is, for the time being, hopelessly crippled,
there <em>are</em> other nations who desire to rise, and may succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in rising, to an occasion which, for the awful cause of it, one
can only hope will never occur again.</p>

<p>It is a truly great opportunity for both British and United
States Commerce, in which, as has been pointed out, the
former has a very considerable start in the political and
commercial sympathies and prejudices of South Americans.
Nothing which British manufacturers cannot remedy appears
to exist to prevent them from taking extremely profitable
advantage of that start, not only for the recovery of lost
ground, but for grasping a very large share of new openings.
Will they? Do they really care enough about extending
their businesses to do so?</p>

<p>That is the only question, and it is one which they alone
can, and soon, we hope, must answer; one way or the other.
If they do not want new business or wish that old business
should come back to them, there is no more to be said. And
no more grumbling to be indulged in about the proportionate
falling back of British trade in South America.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the United States, the full manufacturing
activities of which remain unimpaired by the withdrawal
of labour for military purposes and the output of
which is not absorbed to so great an extent as it is with us
for war material, have for that reason already a great start
of Great Britain in all foreign markets. To this objection I
would reply that the time for the struggle for the Argentine
and Uruguayan markets is hardly yet; because climatic
accident still recently produced results which, coupled with
the falling on them of the shadow of the Great Terror,
suspended their purchasing power. Two very lean years of
cereal production due to weather, the occurrence of two
consecutive seasons of which is without parallel in these
countries’ history, were followed by another perilously
rainy harvest time complicated by shortage of harvest
labour due to war risks, and imagined risks, of the transport
of the usual army of Italian harvesters who (like the <i lang="es">Golondrinas</i>—swallows—after
which they are nicknamed in South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
America) annually go to Argentina and Uruguay<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and return
to Italy after the harvest has been got in. These causes
temporarily paralysed Argentine and Uruguayan commercial
activity by, as has been said, suspending the purchasing
powers of both.</p>

<p>But with the productive recovery<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of these countries with
their enormous natural endowments and producing as they
do all the foodstuffs that the populations of poor war-trampled
Europe need most, what a call for all kinds of
agricultural machinery will come from them in return for
their meat and cereals and in order that more and more land
may be laid under contribution for the production of these
primarily necessary supplies! Failing other labour sources,
an augmented stream of Italian “swallow” and permanent
emigration will set out for the River Plate, wealth will
develop on both shores of that river, and with wealth the
demand for all the manufactured things to the desire for
which wealth gives rise. Hardware, cutlery, cotton and
woollen cloths, electrical appliances and material; the host
of things which Britain makes and Germany once sold will
come into increasing demand in South America with the
spring of the new era on which the whole civilized world will
enter when the blackness of devastation shall have passed
and the evil which created it be rendered powerless for
further ruinous crime.</p>

<p>Would that the millions of able-bodied men murdered by
this war could have been utilized instead as an agricultural
expeditionary force on the shores of the River Plate! They
and their children and the world would have been the richer
for their labour carried out under conditions as happy as
their present, and for many (alas!) past, task is terrible.
They would have supplied that in which Argentina and
Uruguay are lacking, namely, the human element, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
development of their natural resources. Countries in which
vast areas of land yet await the plough for cereal cultivation
and the improvement of their natural rough pasturage and
other vast areas of rich alluvial soil need only irrigation to
turn them into a terrestrial paradise.</p>

<p>Capital never is and never will be wanting for good
investment, but the fund of human labour cannot be drawn
upon by a mere signature. And the daily waste of thousands
of lives for the full activity of which there is ample room
and urgent need on behalf of the millions remaining is,
sentiment apart and from a commercial point of view alone,
the saddest thing in War.</p>

<p>Europe needs bread and meat not only to fulfil her normal
needs but also to replace her own interrupted production of
these prime necessities of life. The River Plate countries can
produce both in practically unlimited quantities; provided
only that they can obtain the necessary labour a ghastly
wastage of which is going on daily in Europe, some parts of
which are consequently threatened with famine.</p>

<p>Surely if civilization be anything but a mere theoretic
expression there will never be another great war!</p>

<p>With this pious hope we may pass to a more concrete subject,
namely, commercial credit on both sides of the River Plate.</p>

<p>As has been indicated in another chapter, Uruguay enjoys
a more literally creditable reputation than her bigger sister.
The causes of this have also been already dealt with.</p>

<p>In practice one can but advise anyone approached by
firms in either country to do what it may be taken that any
ordinarily prudent man of business would do, viz. to make
due enquiry as to his proposed new customer. His means of
doing this are really even better than if the latter were
established in London or New York, since the commercial
community in either Argentina or Uruguay is comparatively
small and consequently, to use a current phrase, almost everyone
there knows everyone else and a good deal about him and
his business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Several of the chief banks in Buenos Aires and Montevideo
have their head offices in London and all have branches or
accredited correspondents in the principal European and
North American capitals and commercial centres.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The wholesale importing houses in Argentina and Uruguay
usually give ninety days’ acceptances for imported goods and
in their turn give six months’ credit to their retail customers.
This arrangement has now the sanction of long usage based
on its practically being a division of the burden of credit
given to the storekeeper by the Importer between the latter
and the Exporter.</p>

<p>The system of banking in both Argentina and Uruguay
differs little from that obtaining in England except for a
certain amount of good single-name paper being taken on
account of the usually intimate acquaintance with the
business and standing of all leading firms possessed by the
commercial community generally.</p>

<p>Rents and working expenses, including special traders’
taxes, in the Capitals of both Republics are high, but the
scale of profits when calculated on anything like a reasonable
turnover will in most cases be found to leave a balance
in favour of both wholesale and retail traders which would be
regarded as highly satisfactory by their European and North
American brethren. In fact, it may fairly be said that if a
man in either country does any appreciable bulk of business
in any branch of commerce or trade he is doing what elsewhere
would be considered as very good business indeed.
When rumour assigns shakiness to any established firm it
may be taken as certain that such rumour is founded on tales
of speculation outside the lines on which that firm’s true
business has been built up. There seems a temptation inherent
in new countries for men who have earned money in
businesses they understand to risk it in other speculations of
which they have next door to no experience. This is, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
course, a phase of the “get rich quick” fever which
frequently attacks the young inheritors of stable businesses
which seem to them too slow and sure to be interesting or
indeed to require much looking after.</p>

<p>At one time the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange was responsible
for a large number of victims among all classes of
the public, but of late years the public has fought very shy of it
indeed; so shy in fact as now to be practically unrepresented
in the share ring of that Institution. As a consequence of this
abstention the few brokers and professional speculators who
daily do what courtesy perhaps demands that one should call
business there suggests the tale of the island the inhabitants
of which lived simply by taking in each other’s washing.</p>

<p>Joking apart, however, the share ring in the Buenos Aires
Temple of Mammon were best avoided by the uninitiate.
In this ring there is always one, sometimes two (its strength
does not run to more), media of pure speculation in course of
manipulation by one speculative group or another. The
names or nature of these media do not really seem to matter.
They vary. Sometimes they may be the shares of the Dock
Company of an inchoate Port, sometimes those of an Industrial
Company with vague expectations. Indeed, vagueness
which may be tinged by rumour and imagination with a
hue dimly resembling that of impending rich surprise is
almost essential to the initiation of this kind of gamble.</p>

<p>The shares are bulled out of all proportion to their even
possible value for a little while and then no more is heard
of them; and other very similar ones reign in their stead in
the sensational place on the blackboard, on which all bargains
during each day are chalked up as they are called out by the
parties making them.</p>

<p>The end of these really stillborn booms is mystery. Who
are the unfortunate last in? Strangers, doubtless, when
there are any. But if there be none, as is the case more
frequently than not? One hears vague talk of Paris and
other European capitals and then silence for ever more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Anyhow, the stranger, for whom this book is chiefly
written, would, if he took a hand in any one of these games,
soon find out that though he might see the price of the
shares he had purchased mounting gaily up on the blackboard
like mercury in the tropics he could never realize to
any appreciable extent. Did he start to sell, then all the
weak little bulls of whom his co-speculators would be composed,
people to whom ten dollars a day one way or the
other makes all the difference in their domestic budget,
would rush to sell also out of sheer fright, and down would
go the market on him like a guillotine. At the finish he
would be left with a very large proportion of his probably
not over-valuable holding; of which he would have little
further news than notices regarding proposed reconstruction
schemes, etc.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be imagined that the Buenos Aires
Stock Exchange is by any means exclusively devoted to such
work as that just indicated. On the contrary, many Bank
and Industrial shares are also quoted and the other, the
Securities, ring is just as genuinely serious as the gambling
part of the share ring is meretricious. The chief securities
dealt in in the former are the Bonds of the National
<i lang="es">Cedulas</i>, as “gilt edged” a security as could well be wished for.</p>

<p>These Cedulas are Bonds issued by the National Hypothecary
Bank, an Institution of the National Government, as
against mortgages of freehold property in the Republic; the
method of their issue being, shortly, as follows.</p>

<p>An intending Mortgagor lodges a proposal with the
Bank; on which his title is examined and the property
offered valued by Government experts appointed for each
purpose.</p>

<p>The result of the examination of title being satisfactory,
the Bank states the amount for which on its valuation, fixed
after leaving ample margin for possible depreciation, it will
accept the mortgage.</p>

<p>But the Bank has no cash funds, and therefore issues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Bonds, carrying interest at 6%, and subject to annual
amortization, for the amount agreed to be granted to the
Mortgagor. The latter, if he require cash, as is usually the
case (most of such borrowings being actually effected with
the objects for which the Bank was founded, viz. improvements
of the property mortgaged, extension of holding, or
purchase of stock and implements), must take his bonds to
the Stock Exchange for sale. For them there is always a free
and open market, the price obtainable usually varying only
according to ordinary accidents of supply and demand.</p>

<p>Many brokers hold standing orders for these Bonds, at a
price, for Europe (before the War Antwerp was always a
buyer at a certain level). The only really appreciable
downward fluctuations of this security are of very short
duration, an hour or two at most, and are due to what can
only be condemned as the inconsiderate action of the
Directors of the Hypothecary Bank. That is to say, the
Bank’s acceptances of Mortgages are sometimes allowed to
accumulate and then, all of a sudden, the Directors seem to
get to work and sign and issue huge batches of Bonds.
Not only do most of these find their way to the Stock Exchange,
in consequence of anticipatory orders lodged with
brokers by absent or upcountry mortgagors, but many such
people leave selling orders with the Bank itself.</p>

<p>The result of all this frequently is that one fine morning or
afternoon cartloads of these Bonds arrive on the Stock
Exchange and flood the market, in spite of all the market
can do with the best intention of sustaining prices.</p>

<p>Soon, however, the mass is absorbed by the home and
foreign demand, and the little crisis which could never have
occurred except through the bad management above described,
is over and normal prices rule again.</p>

<p>All this relates to the current issues of these Bonds, the
“Cedula Argentina” as they are now called.</p>

<p>Formerly they were issued in series, each of which was
distinguished by an alphabetical letter. The last of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
lettered series was “L.” This system of series had inconveniences,
inasmuch as the regulations under which they
were issued prescribed redemption in Bonds of the same
series, which interfered with entirely free dealing; some of the
earlier series being now only obtainable at a high premium
on account of the buyer’s need of them to make up a parcel.</p>

<p>The Securities ring also deals in debenture and other
Bonds—National, Provincial and Municipal. The only
speculation in which it usually indulges being of the very
safest kind; in regard to which, indeed, the term investment
would better apply.</p>

<p>The side of the large Hall of the Exchange opposite to
that occupied by the Stock and Share rings is now tenanted
by the “Bolsa de Cereales,” an institution the recent
creation of which was due to the necessity, arising chiefly
from the rapid developments of the milling industry, for
dealing in “futures” in cereal production.</p>

<p>On the old <i lang="es">Once</i> Corn Exchange such dealings were and
still are tabu, as savouring dangerously of the Chicago
“Pit,” and much heated discussion took place before the
new Exchange was at length authorized to register transactions
in futures. The discussion was useful inasmuch as it
brought about the framing of stringent regulations against
the more ruinous forms of gambling in grain. In the result,
the new Institution works very well and fulfils its ostensible
purpose of assuring the miller against produce being held
against him at times when he is under obligation to deliver
flour. Thus, it has prevented instead of encouraging at
least one vicious class of operations. Formerly, when all
dealing in grain futures was illegal, the miller was continually
at the mercy of operators in the cereal markets.</p>

<p>The Institution of the new Market was imperatively
needed on account of the huge development and value of
the milling industry.</p>

<p>For ordinary dealings the <span class="smcap">Once</span> cereal market still holds
its own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE BUENOS AIRES STOCK EXCHANGE</h3>

<p>One needs some courage to write candidly about this
institution, the more especially if one hopes to enter it
again.</p>

<p>The building itself is the property of a company from
which the members rent it. Part of it is now, as has been
indicated, sublet to the members of the new Cereal Exchange.</p>

<p>One side of the rotunda—the great inner Hall of the
“Bolza”—is therefore now tenanted by the dealers in stocks
and shares, and the other, facing it, by those occupied with
grain. Each exchange has two large blackboards on which
prices are chalked up by attendants as deals are called by
the parties making them. These prices then become official;
and their genuineness is vouched by the fact of their having
been called by members of the Exchange, who are held
responsible by the Committee for the <i lang="la">bona fides</i> of these
announcements.</p>

<p>The rules are now very strict on the question of calling of
<i lang="la">bona fide</i> dealings only. At one time the announcement and
consequent chalking up of fictitious deals (called “gatos,” or,
as we might say, “wild cats”) became so scandalously
frequent and unblushing that a stop had to be put to a
malpractice which deceived the public, since all prices
chalked up are published in the daily papers.</p>

<p>The first, usually, in regard to both the magnitude and
importance of the dealings recorded on it, of these blackboards
or “slates,” as they are called, is that reserved for
transactions in Government and other important stocks;
the second being that devoted to shares.</p>

<p>Thus the first board is mostly filled with records of the
numbers and prices of National Cedulas dealt in, and the
second with those of whatever one or two kinds of shares
may for the time being be in fashion for what one may
bluntly call gambling. For gambling, simply, is the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
almost everything in the shape of speculation in the ephemerally
chosen media. It is in regard to this gambling that the
note of warning to the stranger already sounded may be
repeated here. The really Argentine public has long ago
had its fingers sufficiently often and severely burnt to have
decided to give all Bolza speculation a wide berth. And
here one is brought face to face with a mystery which the
present writer has as yet been wholly unable to explain in
any fully satisfactory way.</p>

<p>This mystery is that, given the fact that the contributions
of the public to Bolza gambling have since long ago become
a negligible quantity, it seems clear that such speculation
must be confined to a limited group of Bolza operators.</p>

<p>How, therefore, is it worth the while of any of these
operators to survive for long as such? They are mostly, if
not all, men of small capital, very small in many cases, yet
there they are, day after day, busily occupied in attributing
usually fictitious values to the shares of one, or at most two
(for the time being) companies. Up go the prices of such
shares, rising each day to giddier heights, till at last like
balloons they disappear from sight and another set of shares
takes their place as material for a boom. Who is the last
man or men left with shares at top price? And what on
earth does he do with them? These be questions the
answers to which are hidden by a secrecy the completeness
and continuity of which do credit to the initiate few whose
common interest it is to maintain it.</p>

<p>The only protection of these people is a mutual defence
against the common enemy, similar to that adopted by professional
buyers at an ordinary auction against any innocent
amateur who may stray into their midst. On the other hand,
the mere presence of a known “bear” among these folk,
completely paralyses all action on their part until his back
is turned again. The writer now has in his mind’s eye a well-known
figure, that of a powerful bear who was the terror of
the speculative markets in the golden days when the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
still played the game and all went merrily except for his
malevolent influence. He alone could frown all prices down;
and he once held them down against the whole of the furious
remainder of the Exchange. It was a never-to-be-forgotten
conflict, from which he emerged victorious and with a name
at which even the puny bulls of to-day still tremble. Though
be it said, he now does little but lend money to those whom
circumstances, or still, occasionally, he himself, have forced
to carry over. Few Bolza members will fail to identify him
from even this slight reference to his fame. The heyday of the
Buenos Stock Exchange was that immediately preceding
the passing of the “Conversion” law which fixed a ratio
between gold and paper and thus ended the speculation in
gold which had grown all too vigorous on wide fluctuations.
After that, wild cats, resorted to as the next best stimulant,
quickly undermined the constitution of the Bolza and
frightened the public; permanently, it would still seem,
from its precincts as far as gambling speculation is concerned.
Such speculation, in any magnitude, has been dead
since 1906; in consequence of the collapse at that time of a
gold fever boom of which a shoal of doomed alluvial dredging
Companies were part cause and part effect.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the real business, of which there is a large and
constant volume, done on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange
is in National “Cedulas.” This business has gradually
gravitated into the hands of a few large brokers. The only
drawback to these Bonds is their name, which might lead
the ignorant in matters South American to confuse them
with the <em>Provincial</em> (Province of Buenos Aires) Cedulas, the
corrupt mismanagement of which caused a great scandal
some years ago. Still “Cedula” means a “Bond,” and it
would, after all, be idle to wish to abolish the latter word
only because some English Bonds may have proved unworthy
of the prestige usually attaching to that designation.</p>

<p>The question has often been raised as to whether, on the
wording of the guarantee endorsed on National Cedulas, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
National Government is responsible for repayment of the
principal as well as the interest on them. This, however,
amounts almost to a quibble; of little, if any, more than
abstract interest. The amortization of these Bonds is certainly
guaranteed in like manner as is the interest on them, and
only some tremendous crisis, now unimaginable, could so
wreck the whole territory of the Republic that land values
throughout that territory would simultaneously fall to an
extent which could render impossible the redemption of
mortgages granted in the first place with a very liberal
margin between the actual market value of the land and the
amounts of the Bonds issued on its security. For, it should
be noted in this connection, a Cedula is not issued by the
Bank on the Security of such or such designated property,
it is issued on the security, guaranteed by the Bank after
due investigation, of <em>all</em> the mortgages held by it. So that,
in effect, even if the whole of a Province were to be engulfed
by an earthquake, the security of none of the Bank’s Cedulas
would be affected by the loss since, at the margin reserved
by the Bank, all the remainder of the lands on which it holds
mortgages would still be ample security for all its bonds.</p>

<p>The reader who is already well acquainted with these
matters must forgive me for thus setting them out in so
obvious a way. I ask him to believe that there are still
very many holders of Argentine National Cedulas possessed
of only the vaguest ideas of how their Bonds came into
existence, and practically none as to the real nature of the
security for them, except a general sort of notion that they
are Argentine Government Bonds.</p>

<p>As will be seen, the facts justify my dictum of a few pages
back that these Bonds really offer as gilt-edged a security
as anyone could wish for.</p>

<p>Other securities most commonly dealt in in the Securities
side of the Market are “Credito Argentino,” National
Internal debt, the “Premier Security” of the Country, as
it has been called; and some Provincial and Municipal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Bonds. On the share side, the shares of the various Banks
are usually the subject of the most really important quotations
on the slate.</p>

<p>Many first-class Argentine securities and shares seldom
come on the market.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">RAILWAYS, PORTS AND IMMIGRATION</span></h2>

<h3>RAILWAYS</h3>

<p>It is often said that the foreign, mostly British,
railway community on the River Plate constitutes an
<i lang="la">Imperium in Imperio</i>.</p>

<p>There is no denying the great influence of that community,
but that influence has been rendered inevitable and is
wholly justified by the very large amount of capital which
the railway companies have at stake in these countries;
amounting in Argentina to some £200,000,000 and in Uruguay
some £12,000,000, making a total of some 212 millions
sterling. Of this total a very large proportion in Argentina
and the whole in Uruguay is British.</p>

<p>The total length of railway lines in Argentina is close
on 21,000 miles, and in Uruguay close on 1050 miles.</p>

<p>The predominant gauge in Argentina is that in use by
the four “great” railway companies of that country, viz.
the Buenos Aires Western, the Central Argentine, the Buenos
Aires Great Southern and the Buenos Aires Pacific, that is
to say, the broad, 5 feet 6 inches, while in Uruguay the
great railway company of that country, the Central Uruguay
of Montevideo, and its subsidiary companies use the Standard
Gauge, 4 feet 8½ inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;" id="illus4">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="525" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">TRANSPORTER BRIDGE, PORT OF BUENOS AIRES</p>
</div>

<p>Until 1909 each of the Argentine railway companies was
(as the Uruguayan still are) controlled by the terms of its
particular concession or concessions. In that year, however,
a Law was passed, usually called the “Mitre Law,”
after its initiator, the late Señor Emilio Mitre (an eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Argentine statesman and son of the famous General Mitre,
perhaps Argentina’s greatest President and Historian), by
which all then existing companies agreeing to be bound by
its provisions should be exempt from all National, Provincial
and Municipal taxation and Import Duties on
material until the year 1947; they, on their part, to pay
to the National Government a single tax of 3% on their
net earnings, the amount of such earnings to be ascertained
by deducting 10% (for working expenses) from their gross
receipts.</p>

<p>Only one Company was then enjoying even more favourable
terms under its original concession than those given
by the Mitre Law; but as that concession was approaching
the time of its expiration it would have been ill-judged on
the part of the Company to have shown itself recalcitrant
to the evident wishes of the Argentine Government.</p>

<p>Therefore it exercised its option in favour of the Mitre
Law, as did all the other Companies.</p>

<p>Though the Argentine and Uruguayan Railway Companies
rely for their usually very handsome profits much more on
haulage of Cereals and Live Stock than on their passenger
traffic, it must not be supposed that the latter is in any way
neglected by them. Quite the contrary is the case. Possibly
nowhere else in the world (except, perhaps, in Russia) is
railway travelling as comfortable as on the River Plate,
either as regards day or night accommodation or catering,
the latter at moderate prices. All is roomy, well arranged
and extremely comfortable; but the <i lang="fr">trains de luxe</i> of the
River Plate are those which the Buenos Aires Great Southern
Company runs to and from Mar-del-Plata in the season,
with Pullman Drawing-room and Dining Cars. The permanent
way is good and the running smooth over almost
the whole of the two Republics. Trains going to the hotter
regions are provided with baths.</p>

<p>Besides British, considerable French and Belgian capital
is invested in Argentine railways. The “Province of Santa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Fé” and the “Province of Buenos Aires” railways are
controlled by French Companies.</p>

<p>Incidentally it may be mentioned that in recent years
most of the shares of the “Anglo-Argentine” Tramways
Company (which owns the principal tramway system of the
Capital) had found their way to Belgium.</p>

<p>A short while ago a United States Syndicate, deemed
powerful and feared as menacing a monopoly, obtained
control of some of the River Plate lines, notably those of
the Central Córdoba, Santa Fé and Entre Rios Companies,
under certain arrangements. This Syndicate has since,
however, been unable to command the capital necessary
to fulfil its part of those arrangements, and, practically, the
control of the lines has now reverted to the original Companies,
the first and last named of which are British.</p>

<p>The Argentine National Government has during the past
few years built and has under construction several lines
intended to develop districts which as yet do not offer
sufficient temptation to private Companies.</p>

<p>No fresh construction has been begun in either country
since the outbreak of the War, the Government and various
Companies confining themselves only to such construction
work as is absolutely necessary for the completion of
extensions already commenced.</p>

<p>Railway construction in these countries does not usually
offer any great difficulties. The triumphs of River Plate
railway engineering were the line of the Buenos Aires
Pacific Railway up and through the Andes and some parts
of the lines of the Entre Rios Railway Company in parts
of that Province in which for long it seemed impossible
to discover a route amid the marshy or spongy soil. Another
such triumph will probably occur when the Buenos Aires
Great Southern Railway penetrates the Andes, as it no
doubt will do one day, much further south than the Buenos
Aires Pacific line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h3>PORTS</h3>

<p>The River Plate Republics are very accessible to foreign
Commerce; possessing Atlantic Coasts, the River Plate and
its two great navigable tributaries, the Uruguay and the
Paraná.</p>

<p>The Port of Buenos Aires ranks seventh among the ports
of the world in respect of the value of merchandise which
enters and leaves it, and second in America, that is to say,
coming immediately after New York. The next most
important Argentine ports are those of Rosario, Bahia
Blanca and La Plata; after which come Santa Fé, San
Nicholás, Campana and Zárate, and many others on the
Paraná and Rio Gallegos, Puerto Madryn, San Antonio
and others on the South Atlantic. A new Port is in course
of construction at Mar-del-Plata.</p>

<p>Montevideo only ranks in point of cargo values just before
Bahia Blanca; that is to say, with some £15,000,000 as
against the £115,500,000 trade of the Port of Buenos Aires.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Uruguay is, however, preparing in this regard for her
further development by large new port works which have
been under construction for some years past. On the
Uruguay she has Fray Bentos, Paysandú (both largely
concerned with meat extract and preserved meats export),
Salto and Santa Rosa; and on the River Plate, besides
Montevideo, Colonia and Maldonado; besides several
relatively unimportant ports having as yet but scanty or
no effective accommodation for vessels. This could also
have been said of many of Argentina’s minor ports not so
very long ago. Port accommodation in Uruguay will follow
the increase and demands of her export produce and the
requirements of her consequently enhanced prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<h3>IMMIGRATION</h3>

<p>As has been noticed under the heading “Racial Elements,”
most of the immigration to the River Plate has
hitherto passed Montevideo and landed at Buenos Aires.
Over 300,000 immigrants landed in Argentina in 1913;
composed chiefly, and in point of numerical importance, in
the following order, of Spaniards, Italians, “Turcos”
(Syrians or Levantines), Russians (mostly Jewish), French,
Germans, Austrians, Portuguese and British. British
arrivals on the River Plate consist chiefly of the salaried
classes; who, not being classed as immigrants, do not
appear on the Government returns from which the above
figures are taken. The only other noteworthy point about
Argentine immigration is that now the Spanish element
largely predominates instead of, as formerly, the Italian.</p>

<p>During the past twenty years the foreign trade of
Argentina and Uruguay (especially that of the
former country) has developed very largely and
rapidly; its increase during the decade 1904-1913 being,
in the case of Argentina, 108½% and in that of Uruguay
104%. The increase in both cases is considerably greater
than that of the trade of any other South American country;
as will be seen from the following figures:—</p>

<p>The figure $996,215,998 gold if divided by 7,731,257,
representing the population of Argentina, gives $129 gold,
or £25 11s. 10d., value of trade per inhabitant of that
country; a very high figure indeed. The value of the trade
of Uruguay per head of her population is £21 3s. 6d.</p>

<p>In 1913 Argentina alone provided the markets of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
United Kingdom with cereals and meat to the value of
£34,500,000 of a total of £92,300,000, or nearly 37½% of its
total supplies. During the same year Uruguay sent meat
to the United Kingdom to the value of some £202,000
sterling.</p>

<p>During the five years 1908-1912 48½% of the whole
maize imported by the United Kingdom came from Argentina;
or only a little less than the total quantity of
that imported from the United States, Roumania, Russia,
India, Natal, Canada, Bulgaria and the Cape of Good
Hope.</p>

<p>In respect of the total issue of Capital in the United
Kingdom during the first six months of 1914, Argentina
ranked <em>first</em> (with £12,809,200 as against £12,244,100 which
went to Russia) among the foreign countries for which such
issues were destined; and <em>third</em> if British Possessions are
included in the comparison.</p>

with the same promptitude and regularity as those of
Argentina, to say nothing of the admirable clearness of the
forms in which the latter are issued. The Uruguayan
authorities should really know that the absence of any
complete scheme of statistical information regarding their
country is more than apt to preserve a very common
though erroneous impression that Uruguay can be of but
little account since so little is known or heard of it. Little
indeed is known with any accuracy of its production, outside
the circle of persons directly interested in its trade;
but this obscurity is due only to indifference to and negligence
of the art of self-assertion.</p>

<p>In point of fact Uruguay might well be proud of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
statistics of her productivity; for, in reality, she has more
cattle than and nearly as many sheep as the Argentine
Province of Buenos Aires while her superficial area is only
some two-thirds of that of that Province. Uruguay exports
wool to the average value of some £4,000,000, hides
£1,500,000, frozen and chilled meat £1,110,000, and animals
on the hoof £230,000 annually. The value of its wheat
exports for the five years ending 1910 has been stated
at £730,000; flour £234,000, maize £82,000 and linseed
£460,000 during the same period. As we have seen, the
value of Uruguayan trade for the year 1913 was £23,900,000,
and this figure, as well as those representing Cereal production
and exports, are likely to be rapidly increased under
normal conditions.</p>

<p>Wool constitutes about nine-tenths of the exports of
Uruguay.</p>

<p>Up to and including 1907 the Imports of Uruguay were
in excess of her Exports. In 1908, however, the balance
went the other way and is likely to remain there.</p>

<p>The excess of Exports over Imports in 1908 was valued
at $2,840,206 (Uruguayan) and in 1909 at $7,966,658. In
1912 the Imports appear to have risen to $49,380,000 as
against exports $51,000,000. Probably these last figures are
roughly accurate; but the last year for which any full official
Statistics appear to have been published was 1911.</p>

<p>As has already been seen, the chief countries of destination
of Argentine Exports prior to the War were (generally in
the following order): The United Kingdom, Germany,
France, Belgium, Brazil, the United States, Holland and
Italy. Those of Uruguay went chiefly to France, Belgium,
Germany, Argentina and the United Kingdom. While
Argentina Imported principally from the United Kingdom,
Germany, the United States, France, Italy, Belgium and
Spain; and Uruguay from the United Kingdom, Germany,
the United States, France, Italy, Belgium and Argentina.</p>

<p>The Surplus of Revenue over Expenditure in both
Republics may appear to remain always so small as only
just to have avoided conversion into deficits. It should,
however, be recollected that these countries are constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
engaged in carrying out Public Works which are necessary
to the fuller development of their natural resources; such,
for instance, as the very important new Port Works of
Buenos Aires and Montevideo and the great Argentine
systems of irrigation. Were the excess of Revenue greater
it would still be spent, and wisely spent, on National Public
Works and Improvements; which are the best assurance
of its future which either country could make.</p>

<p>An instance of the rapid Commercial progress of the River
Plate Countries is the fact that whereas in 1872 there were
but four Banks in Argentina, in 1913 there were 143.</p>

<p>The latest (1914) Commercial and Industrial Census of
the City of Buenos Aires shows that the number of Commercial
(chiefly wholesale and retail trading) establishments
in that City has increased from 17,985, as shown by the
previous Census of 1904, to 29,600—an increase of 65%—while
the number of Factories and Manufacturing establishments
which in 1904 was 8,877 was in 1914 11,132—an
increase of 25%. The motive power employed in these last-mentioned
establishments has increased during the same
period from 19,458 h.p. to 194,411 h.p.—an increase of
900%—while the number of persons employed has increased
112%.</p>

<p>An amusing but characteristic note is struck by comparison
of the figures representing the annual sales of
flour and tobacco respectively, the former being nearly
$48,000,000 (paper) and the latter nearly £44,000,000
(paper).</p>

<p>Not such a great difference between the money spent in
Buenos Aires on flour, much of which is exported, and on
tobacco, which is all home consumed! Another is that
nearly 1% of the whole population of the City consists of
Medical Men; Brokers and Commission Agents (clubbed
together and classed as professional men by the Census) run
them very close, with Builders a good third, and the rest,
in the sporting sense, nowhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the wholesale and retail traders are Italians,
Spaniards and Argentines, in this order; the Italians being
in both cases nearly three times and the Spaniards nearly
twice as numerous as the Argentines. After them come
French, Russians (chiefly Jewish), Levantines and Egyptians
(locally known as “Turcos”), Uruguayans, German,
British and other nationalities in commerce; and French,
Russians, Levantines and Egyptians, Belgians, Danes and
Portuguese and other nationalities as Manufacturers.</p>

<p>A good many establishments of both classes are, however,
shown to belong to Argentines and foreigners in partnership.</p>

<p>It is due to the compilers of the Census to remark that
they have treated “Jews” as pertaining to a separate
nationality, though therefore there is possibly some confusion
under the heading “Russians.”</p>

<span class="smaller">A GLANCE AT THE PROVINCES AND NATIONAL
TERRITORIES OF ARGENTINA, AND THE INTERIOR
OF URUGUAY</span></h2>

<h3>BUENOS AIRES</h3>

<p>This is the largest and most densely populated and
the most uniformly prosperous Province of the
Republic.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It is bounded on the North by the
Provinces of Santa Fé and Córdoba, on the West by the
Territories of the Pampa Central and Rio Negro and on
the East and South by the Paraná and Plate Rivers and
the Atlantic Ocean. Its capital, La Plata, is of a somewhat
sadly monumental aspect. It is indeed as yet but a monument
to the still unrealized dreams of its modern founders
and architects. It was to have been a great city with a
busy port; it is now a place where Provincial parliamentarians,
lawyers, university students and Law Court and
Police officials spend some hours each day, coming each
morning and returning each evening from and to the
superior activity and attractions of the Federal Capital.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, La Plata has long, wide, eucalyptus-planted
avenues; its chief Plaza, in which are the Municipality and
the Cathedral, is not much smaller than Trafalgar Square;
its Museum is world-renowned for its palæontological
collections; and its Law Courts, University, Theatre,
Police Offices and the above-mentioned Municipality are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
huge, magnificently solid-looking buildings. But the lack
of all perceptible movement in La Plata leads one to imagine
that if its broad avenues and noble Plazas are not grass-grown
the fact is due much more to the action of street
cleaners than to that of traffic. Truly, one may often gaze
down a very long vista of pavement between tall eucalyptus
trees for many minutes without seeing one single other
human being.</p>

<p>The Port works of Buenos Aires have drained its only
source of commerce from La Plata. Still, some day the
trade of the Republic may need it also.</p>

<p>At the same time it is only just to add that La Plata
makes out a claim to nearly 100,000 inhabitants. Where
they all get to when one visits it is mystery. Perhaps they
in their turn spend their days in Buenos Aires; returning
home to sleep in the deep stillness of the Provincial Capital.</p>

<p>The real chief port of the Province of Buenos Aires is
Bahia Blanca. First of all, in 1896, the National Government
decided to build the naval port and arsenal now in
existence there: subsequently the Buenos Aires Great
Southern and the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway Companies
realized the conveniences and situation of Bahia
Blanca as a place of export for the produce of their great
and ever-increasing southern and south-western zones and
each company constructed a port for the almost exclusive
purposes of its own traffic.</p>

<p>The Great Southern Railway’s port is called <span class="smcap">Ingeniero
White</span> and that of the Pacific Railway <span class="smcap">Puerto Galvan</span>.
Besides these, separate and distinct constructions, Bahia
Blanca has a fourth port, <span class="smcap">Cuatreros</span>, at the interior end
of the bay, which exports large and increasing quantities
of frozen and chilled meat.</p>

<p>The great railway ports of Bahia Blanca are fitted with
every modern mechanical appliance, huge cranes, electric
endless belts for loading loose grain, and immense grain
warehouses and elevators. The town of Bahia Blanca is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
rapidly growing in importance and influence. Its municipal
administration is largely in the hands of British exporters
and merchants.</p>

<p>On the Atlantic coast, between Bahia Blanca and Buenos
Aires and some 400 kilometres from the latter city, is the
famous seaside resort of Mar-del-Plata, the Argentine Monte
Carlo—Trouville-Biarritz-cum-Ostend (before the War!).</p>

<p>During the season there (at all other times of the year it
is deserted) vast Hotels and Restaurants charge famine
prices for accommodation and food and there is always
more demand than available supply of either. Wealthy
Argentine families have, of course, their palatial “Chalets,”
and the <span class="smcap">Rambla</span>, as the great promenade by the sea is
called, is a very brilliant scene at all times during the weeks
in which it is fashionable.</p>

<p>Music and dancing contribute to the nights’ amusement
at the Casino, large Hotels and private houses; and at the
Club members can indulge in those games in which chance
plays a greater rôle than skill.</p>

<p>As one young gentleman, who had failed to get a bed at
any of the Hotels he thought worthy of his patronage, once
remarked, “No matter, one can always play Baccarat till
it is bathing time again.”</p>

<p>The air of Mar-del-Plata, that of the wide Atlantic, would
doubtless be a powerful restorative to anyone who could
resist the temptations of amusement sufficiently to give it
a chance. Some people possibly do, but if so keep very
silent about it.</p>

<p>Mar-del-Plata is, however, destined to show a more
serious side of its possibilities in consequence of the building
of a commercial port; the construction of which has been
entrusted to a French firm, also the constructors of the new
port works of Montevideo. Potatoes which are deemed the
best in the Republic come from near Mar-del-Plata.</p>

<p>Other chief towns of the Province of Buenos Aires are
<span class="smcap">Avellaneda</span> (situate on the Provincial side of the boundary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
line between the Province and the Federal City of Buenos
Aires, but to all intents and purposes a district of the latter
with which it is connected by unbroken lines of streets and
houses), <span class="smcap">Chivilcoy</span>, <span class="smcap">Pergamino</span>, <span class="smcap">Tres Arroyos</span>, <span class="smcap">Nueve
de Julio</span>, <span class="smcap">Azul</span>, the residential suburbs (of Buenos Aires),
<span class="smcap">Temperley</span> and <span class="smcap">Lomas de Zamorra</span> and many smaller
“camp” towns.</p>

<p>All these minor camp towns of the Province of Buenos
Aires look much alike and none of them are very interesting
in appearance. Their stores, however, do good business in
supplying the needs of large surrounding rural districts, and
some of these towns have periodical cattle shows and sales
which are well worth visiting.</p>

<p>Temperley and Lomas de Zamorra consist chiefly of
Villa residences, of all sizes and styles of architecture, and
some shops.</p>

<p>The Province of Buenos Aires, half as large again as
the whole Republic of Uruguay, possesses some of the best
land in Argentina, and in it farming has reached the highest
developments as yet attained in either Republic. In it
intensive farming has already made its first appearance in
South America—as needs must when high land-values drive.
The surface of this Province is one almost unbroken level
plain.</p>

<p>It at present produces one-third of the whole output of
wheat, nearly a similar proportion of maize, one-fifth that
of linseed, 87% of that of oats, and also contains about 37%
of the live stock of the whole Republic.</p>

<p>Good water is obtainable nearly everywhere in practically
close proximity to the surface. This fact, combined with
the comparatively few running streams and the tendency
of these to dry up in hot weather, causes some parts of this
Province to have the appearance of a forest of tall skeleton
iron windmills. These are set up over artificially sunk wells,
to draw water for animals and domestic purposes.</p>

<p>A detailed description of the Province of Buenos Aires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
would extend to a very great length indeed; as this Province
is, as far as its climatic conditions permit, a compendium
of the industrial activity, at its best, of the whole Republic.
That it is so is due to its situation on, or always in relatively
close proximity to, the estuary of the River Plate; the
cradle of the civilization and progress of the countries under
discussion.</p>

<p>Farming and most other industries find their highest
expression within easy reach of and in the Federal Capital.</p>

<p>As far as its physical aspect is concerned, the Province
of Buenos Aires has been accused with considerable justice
of being generally uninteresting. Certainly its surface is
one huge flat plain, until one gets south to the ranges of the
Sierra de la Ventana and the Tandíl hills. Past them,
nothing but monotonous plain again till its southernmost
boundary, the Rio Colorado, is reached.</p>

<p>Its only romantic scenery, though that is delightful
indeed, is on its north-eastern frontier, along the small River
Tigre and the majestic Paraná; the banks and innumerable
islands of which are clad with useful osiers, flowering reeds,
peach trees and a large riot of other beautiful and luxuriant
vegetation. Many a spring day can be passed in idyllic
enjoyment among the islands of the Tigre.</p>

<p>At Tandíl, on the south-eastern side of the Province,
there are quarries of fine marble and building stone, and
until a year or so ago there was a famous rocking-stone
perched on another rock, the surface of which is inclined
at an angle of something like 45 degrees. To all appearances
a mere gust of wind would have toppled the upper stone
down into a hollow beneath; but the tale goes that Señor
Benito Villanueva, a wealthy and sportsmanlike Argentine,
once tied a rope round the rocking-stone and attached the
other end to a double span of oxen on the plain below. The
oxen pulled; but without any other effect on the rocking-stone
than temporarily to cant it just as many centimetres
as it could be moved by a good push from a man’s hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Now, alas for Tandíl, someone has succeeded in dislodging
the rocking-stone from its uncanny-looking eminence, so
that it has, literally, fallen from its high celebrity.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires is, naturally, the Province of palatial
estancia houses surrounded by model farms. The Queen
Province. The most densely populated and cultivated and
the one with the largest revenues.</p>

<h3>SANTA FÉ</h3>

<p>This Province ranks next to that of Buenos Aires in
respect of area and population, while its output of both
maize and linseed is slightly greater than that of the
Queen Province; in regard to wheat it stands third
among the Argentine Provinces, Córdoba coming immediately
after Buenos Aires, and in respect of oats it again
comes second. In point of live stock it comes only fifth,
after Buenos Aires, Entre Rios, Corrientes and Córdoba.</p>

<p>It is bounded on the North by the Territory of the Chaco,
on the West by the Provinces of Santiago del Estero and
Córdoba, on the South by the Province of Buenos Aires
and on the East by the River Paraná.</p>

<p>The northern part of Santa Fé is covered with vast
forests, continuations of those of the Provinces of Santiago
del Estero and the Territory of the Chaco. These forests
are rich in Quebracho wood, and from them also come large
supplies of firewood and charcoal.</p>

<p>The other parts of Santa Fé are devoted to stock and
agriculture.</p>

<p>The streams of this Province, although more numerous
than those of Buenos Aires, have (with the exception of the
great River Paraná) the same tendency to dry up as have
those of the Queen Province, and, therefore, water-drawing
windmills are in proportionate evidence.</p>

<p>Its Capital, the city from which it takes its name, is one
of the oldest in the River Plate countries. Its movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
is, however, little else than that of a merely political capital;
the town of Rosario, with its port, being the centre of most
of the commercial activity of this part of the Republic.
Until the rise of Bahia Blanca, Rosario held the undisputed
rank of the second commercial centre of Argentina.</p>

<p>The City of Santa Fé nevertheless possesses an old-world
beauty and charm, with its palm avenues and spacious
Plazas, its many churches and its large one-storied residences.
Rosario, on the other hand, is as unsightly and
uninteresting a place to the eye as could well—or, rather
badly—be conceived. It has, however, a large share of the
cereal export trade. This Province has also other important
ports on the Paraná, viz. the port of Santa Fé itself, Villa
Constitution, Colastiné and several minor ones, all of which
are available for ocean-going ships.</p>

<p>After Buenos Aires, Santa Fé is the Province with by far
the greatest and most conveniently situated railway mileage.</p>

<p>Mixed agriculture and stock farming is practised in many
districts; though Santa Fé has not yet felt the economic
need of other than extensive farming. Still, land values
have, until recent events prejudicially, if only temporarily,
affected all such values, followed those in Buenos Aires on
an upward course. Santa Fé sends large quantities of
potatoes to the Buenos Aires and local markets.</p>

<p>The milling industry of this Province ranks not only next
in importance to that of Buenos Aires, but its output of
flour is very much greater than that of Entre Rios, the next
most important Province in this regard. The Department
of Reconquista, in the North of the Province, has sugar
mills, and other industries are the production of ground-nut
oil, dairy produce, tanneries, preserved meats and maize
alcohol.</p>

<h3>CÓRDOBA</h3>

<p>This Province is bounded on the North by the Province
of Santiago del Estero, on the North-West by the Province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of Catamarca, on the West by the Province of La Rioja and
San Luis, on the South by the Territory of the Pampa
Central and the Province of Buenos Aires, and on the East
by the Province of Santa Fé.</p>

<p>Córdoba is the second Province of the Republic in point
of wheat and linseed production, being not far behind
Buenos Aires in this regard. Its maize production, however,
does not amount to one-third of that of either Buenos Aires
or Santa Fé, while in oats it about ties with the latter.
In live stock it ranks fourth among the Argentine Provinces,
though it has less than half the number possessed by Entre
Rios and only about half of that of Corrientes. In the matter
of population it ranks fourth among the Provinces of the
Republic, with about one-third that of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>As one travels towards the ancient capital of this Province
one begins to realize that the cosmopolitan delights of the
city of Buenos Aires do not reflect the soul of the Republic:
the soul that fought for its liberty under the blue sky and
warm sun of 25th of May, now over a hundred years ago.
One begins involuntarily to dream of the Gaucho Wars and
to feel the atmosphere of wilder bygone times amid the
steep water-cut and cacti-crowned banks of the five great
rivers which traverse the land from west to east. And when
one gets to “The Learned City” the illusion is not dispelled.
Only one extremely modern-looking Hotel in a corner of the
Plaza jars; the rest of old Córdoba exhales the magnolia-scented
atmosphere of Old Colonial days. The Cathedral,
the University (founded in 1613) and the innumerable
churches, the bells of which all clang incessantly on Feast-days,
all help to preserve in the old part of the City of
Córdoba an atmosphere of the Middle Ages, when monasteries
and learning were indissolubly connected. And of
monks and nuns, brown-robed, black-robed, white-robed
and blue-robed, many there be in Córdoba. Wherever
one looks, across the Plaza, up one street or down another,
one sees them walking in twos or small groups with a uniformly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
measured step which, as one instinctively feels,
nothing could hurry nor retard. And the black-coated
citizens of Córdoba walk silently with eyes downcast. But
there is fierceness behind those cast-down eyes and quick
hot blood in the veins of those men in black; as anyone
would soon find out to his cost were he suspected of too
close enquiry into local political ways and means.</p>

<p>The writer speaks feelingly on this subject since when,
a few years ago, he was visiting Córdoba with a quite natural
but equally innocent curiosity for the old-world corners of
the City, he unfortunately disclosed in conversation with an
eminently respectable-looking, immaculately dressed gentleman
that he, the present author, was a journalist.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards his adventures began. He was molested
in indirect ways, and finally invited to pay a visit to the
Central Police Station. There he was given cigarettes and
coffee by the Comisario, who floridly apologized and expressed
his deep regret and shame for the treatment an
honourable stranger had received. It was, however, but
a series of regrettable accidents arising from unfortunate
error of certain bad characters who were now in durance vile
in consequence.</p>

<p>Here he rang a bell and ordered the answering policeman
to bring in the culprits. They were duly brought in and
recognized.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the Comisario, “you will have no more
trouble. Besides,” he added, “one of our plain-clothes men
will accompany you in future wherever you go—for your
better protection.”</p>

<p>The plain-clothes man certainly obeyed orders; so persistently
that the whole why and wherefore at last dawned
on my confused brain.</p>

<p>The intention was to worry me so much in a polite quasi-legitimate
fashion that I could have no ostensible cause of
complaint; but, at the same time, so that I should incontinently
quit the ancient City of Córdoba in disgust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
The reason for all this was the fact that, having nothing
better to do on the evening of my arrival, I had wandered
into the basement of my Hotel and there found a person
who looked like, and indeed was, a leading local politician
running a roulette to catch the nickels of a crowd of
working men. At that time the roulette was the scarcely
concealed vice of the town, rife in the back room of every
bar.</p>

<p>It is an illegal game in Argentina, as elsewhere except
Monte Carlo, and shortly after my visit it was the cause of
a great outcry and scandal in which several Provincial High
Officials were involved.</p>

<p>I was a journalist and, therefore, dangerous. So a course
of delicate hints to me to get out had been planned and
executed.</p>

<p>Following the gambling scandal, a leading Opposition
politician was shot dead in his carriage on the high road a
short way outside the city. When I read this news I was
glad that I had not persisted in seeming to pry into cupboards
containing Córdoba’s official skeletons, and for
similar reasons I am still somewhat shy of Córdobese gentlemen
with downcast eyes and soft, measured tread.</p>

<p>All that, however, belongs to <span class="smcap">Old</span> Córdoba. The parts
of the city called New Córdoba and Alta Córdoba are replete
with palatial residences as fine and as new as residential
palaces need be.</p>

<p>The City of Córdoba is not only the traditional seat of
learning <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> of the Republic, it is also, as a consequence
of old-time associations no doubt, its chief centre of
clerical influence.</p>

<p>Córdoba is intensely and, if one may be permitted to say
it, intolerantly Catholic. Were it not subject to the democratic
laws of a modern and very go-ahead Republic one
would hardly be surprised to find disciplinary institutions
of an Inquisitorial type still in full swing in this old-world
city of South America. As it is, there is no doubt of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
predominance of priestly influence in Provincial politics.
Much of the best freehold property in the city is owned by
Monastic Orders or by the Society of Jesus.</p>

<p>Most of the Province consists of a large plain; which,
naturally, is the chief productive area. But Córdoba has
hills famous for the purity of their air and great resorts for
consumptive patients. <span class="smcap">Alta Gracia</span>, with its fine hotel,
golf links, etc., has of late years acquired a very favourable
reputation as a place in which anyone may spend a very
pleasant and healthful week or so.</p>

<p>In the North-West of the Province are great salt marshes,
in and around which only a very scanty and meagre vegetation
flourishes, and in the North-East is the <span class="smcap">Mar Chiquita</span>,
a large and, in parts, very deep lake, the waters of which
are salty like those of the sea. Hence its name.</p>

<p>Córdoba also possesses large forests, as yet chiefly exploited
for building timber and firewood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rio Cuarto</span>, on the river of that name, is the next
largest town in the Province in point of population, but it
is likely soon to be altogether surpassed in importance by
<span class="smcap">Bell Ville</span>, on the Central Argentine Railway, a rapidly
advancing centre of the cereal trade, and some day also,
probably, by <span class="smcap">Marcos Juarez</span>, comparatively close to it on
the same line.</p>

<p>Goats abound in the North of Córdoba. Land values
have increased and are increasing; especially in the most
fertile regions in the South-Eastern parts of the Province.</p>

<p>Córdoba has given and continues to give much attention
to irrigation and possesses one of the largest semi-natural
reservoirs in the world, certainly in South America, in the
<span class="smcap">Dique San Roque</span>, which is formed by means of a wall of
masonry placed across the mouth of a mountain gorge.
Its capacity is 260,000,000 cubic metres, and its operation
is completed by a basin situated some fifteen miles from
and below it, from which the water flows through two great
primary canals. The area so irrigated is some 130,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
hectares. Other large irrigation works are in course of
construction, and more still are under consideration.</p>

<p>Córdoba has also a large share of industrial enterprise,
of which the chief are lime and cement works, ornamental
and other tile manufactories, potteries, sawmills and butter
factories.</p>

<p>The hills of this Province have some practically unexploited
mineral deposits. The area between the city of
Córdoba and the Provinces of Santa Fé and Buenos Aires
is covered with a close network of railway lines, in great
contrast (as may be seen by a glance at the railway map)
in this respect with the more Northern parts of the Province.</p>

<p>There has for a long time been talk of a canal to run from
near the city of Córdoba to a point close to the port of
Rosario, utilizing the surplus waters of the Primero, Segundo
and Tercero Rivers.</p>

<p>There is something almost incongruously prosaic about
the naming, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th, of the rivers which
traverse a Province in which so much of the old romantic
atmosphere lingers.</p>

<p>The Alfalfa fields of Córdoba are in extent second only
to those of Buenos Aires, covering an area equal to more
than half that devoted to this forage in the latter Province.</p>

<h3>ENTRE RIOS</h3>

<p>This Province is bounded on the North by the Province
of Corrientes, on the West and East by, respectively, the
Rivers Paraná and Uruguay (hence its name “Between
Rivers”) and on the extreme South by the River Plate,
which is formed by the conjunction of the Paraná and
Uruguay.</p>

<p>As has been seen, Entre Rios comes second among the
Argentine Provinces for production of oats; but in respect
of other cereal crops it is still far behind Buenos Aires,
Santa Fé and Córdoba. It is, however, rich in live stock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
having nearly three times the quantity possessed by Córdoba.
In point of population it ranks fourth among the
Argentine Provinces.</p>

<p>Until the accomplishment of the Entre Rios railway this
Province was known as the “Poor Sister” of Buenos Aires
and Santa Fé. Now, this disparagement cannot be thrown
on her; for her prosperity is advancing literally by leaps
and bounds. This is very largely owing to the communication
and transport afforded by the Railway and its train-carrying
Ferry Boats which run between <span class="smcap">Zárate</span> on the
Buenos Aires side of the River Paraná and <span class="smcap">Ibicuy</span> on the
Entre Rios side, thus permitting of traffic without change
of car between the Federal City and the Entre Rios system—and,
in fact, also, onward through the Province of Corrientes
and the Republic of Paraguay to Brazil, by several
links in the chain of railway lines one day to run the whole
length from North and South of the two Americas.</p>

<p>The journey by rail from Buenos Aires to Paraná, the
capital of Entre Rios, is a delightful one, not the least
pleasant part of it being the voyage in the well-appointed
Ferry Boats up and across beautiful winding reaches of the
Paraná River.</p>

<p>From the Provincial capital one can again take a train
through interesting country across the Province to Concórdia,
on the River Uruguay, and so back to Buenos Aires
by one of the fine and comfortable River Boats. That is,
if one does not first of all go further North to the famous
falls of Iguazú, further mention of which will be made when
writing of the National Territory of Misiones.</p>

<p>The City of Paraná is a quiet, pleasant Capital, redolent
of the memory of General Urquíza, the one-time “Tyrant”
of these parts of the River Plate Territories. One sees the
old large low building which was the head-quarters of his
government, and where, as history hath it, he contrived to
have many of his political enemies put to death. On the
other hand, there is much evidence of his enlightenment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the shape of schools, first established by him and later
fostered by “The School Master President” Sarmiento.
The fact is that Urquíza, like Rozas, whom he supplanted,
and Artígas, the national hero of Uruguay, were all strong
men of good purpose according to their lights and times;
times which were turbulent and in which it was necessary
for him who would govern to kill first if he would not
himself die by an assassin’s hand.</p>

<p>Opposition politicians had short shrift in those days.
They were caught, convicted and executed almost before the
plots of which they were found guilty had been fully formed.</p>

<p>Each of these tyrants had a far-reaching and minutely
penetrating police system, from which nothing was hid of
the movements and meetings of other people in those
sparsely populated days; days when no man’s business was
a secret to his neighbour. As a result, order sprang out of
disorder and was maintained by iron rule.</p>

<p>Looking back from this distance of time one can perceive
the great and good work done by these men for their
country. Their methods were of the time; necessary.</p>

<p>On the cliff-like bank of the river is the really charming
Urquíza Park. The chief Plaza, “Primero de Mayo,” is
gay o’ nights with electric light shining on the tables outside
the Cafés, whilst a band plays in the midst of the garden in
its centre. Paraná has trams and a theatre, and altogether
is quite a busy commercial centre. Still it is, as has been
said, quiet with the distinctive quiet of really Provincial
towns all the world over.</p>

<p>But the most charming place of all (to the writer’s mind,
one of the most charming in the Republic) is Concórdia.
Its cobbled streets and orange-scented gardens, its pure
air, bright sun and cool breezes combine to give one the
feeling of having at last reached a true haven of rest from
the turmoil of the outer world; a haven in which one might
dream the remainder of one’s life away happy and passing
rich on the Argentine equivalent to forty pounds a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet Concórdia is busy, busy in its old Colonial way with
sending produce down the broad River Uruguay to the great
noisy port of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>The Entre Rios farmers do good business in cattle fattening;
for which their usually well-watered and rich pasturage
is peculiarly fitted. Yet, at times, Entre Rios has suffered
from severe drought, and more frequently from locust
invasion, a plague which, however, is now already fairly
well held in check by the measures adopted and strictly
carried out by Government for the gradual elimination, as
it is hoped, of these insects from the Republic.</p>

<p>Entre Rios, still only just, so to speak, opened up by the
railway, is still conservative in respect of the maintenance
of large land holdings. These are, however, slowly but surely
being divided up owing to demand and in accordance with
the more utilitarian spirit of the times.</p>

<p>Entre Rios is a chief centre of the jerked-beef industry,
and the Liebig factories are an economic feature which
cannot go unmentioned. Grease factories, for which large
quantities of mares are slaughtered annually, also constitute
one of the chief industries of this Province.</p>

<p>Entre Rios has a very considerable acreage under barley.</p>

<h3>CORRIENTES</h3>

<p>Corrientes may be regarded, economically, as well as
geographically, as still being one of the outlying Provinces,
inasmuch as its population and cereal production are much
less than those of the Provinces already dealt with.</p>

<p>It is, however, numerically richer in Live Stock than
either Córdoba or Santa Fé<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and has large areas under
maize cultivation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Corrientes is bounded on the North by the River Paraná,
which forms the boundary between it and the Republic of
Paraguay. This river is also its Western boundary, while
on the East it is bounded by the National Territory of
Misiones and the River Uruguay, and on the South by Entre
Rios.</p>

<p>It is served by the Argentine North-Eastern Railway
system, which links up and is in every way closely connected
with the Entre Rios Railway: and by a small
narrow-gauge industrial railway which runs through a large
area of Quebracho forest and also serves some sugar mills.</p>

<p>Other communication is by old-world diligences. Another
railway is, however, projected to run almost along the north
boundary of the Province from the City of Corrientes to
Posadas in Misiones.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Corrientes, like their Paraguayan
neighbours, from whom, especially in the more Northern
parts of this Province, they differ but slightly in racial
characteristics, are the true lineal descendants of Spanish
soldiery and their native Guaraní Indian wives. They are
as a rule a pleasant enough people, good-humoured and
somewhat indolent. As to the latter quality one must,
however, remember that in Corrientes one is already among
subtropical vegetation (Palms begin to rear their tufted
heads in the North of Entre Rios). One of the most
beautiful examples of this vegetation is the <i lang="es">Lapacho</i> with its
great branches of pink flowers.</p>

<p>One must not delay long, however, if one wish to still
catch the old-world flavour of Corrientes. Its capital,
founded in 1588 with one of the long names in which the
Spanish conquerors appear to have delighted, namely, San
Juan de la Vera de las siete Corrientes (St. John of Vera of
the Seven Streams), is already provided with modern waterworks
and electric trams. Still, one yet finds many mysterious
looking low houses with vertically barred windows, and
covered verandahs lining long narrow streets. Modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
buildings, however, are rapidly spoiling the attraction of the
place for those who appreciate the charm of more leisurely,
spacious times. That charm yet lingers in the city of
Corrientes, but, as has been said, is already being startled
into flight by modernity.</p>

<p>The latter and Corrientes are, nevertheless, still fairly far
apart. It would be curious to know how many inhabitants
of the Federal Capital have even the faintest notion of what
City of the Seven Streams is like (?). Very few indeed;
except those who have or have had direct interests in the
latter place. The notions of the rest would be similar to
those of the average European regarding the Pampa.</p>

<p>Corrientes is for the most part well watered, and has
immense tracts of excellent pasturage.</p>

<p>Besides its Capital, Corrientes possesses as its, even more
commercially important, centres the towns of Goya, famous
for its cheeses, Ituzaingó, Bella Vista, and Empedrado, all
ports or rather possible ports on the Paraná, Mercedes, the
centre of prosperous sheep-farming districts, and Curuzú
Cuatia and Monte Caseros, with good railroad facilities.</p>

<p>With the necessary expenditure on wharves, etc., Corrientes
could be brought into a much greater economic
activity than it shows signs of as yet; by utilizing its great
natural riparian means of communication, although the
River Uruguay is at this height difficult of navigation,
owing chiefly to the rapidity of its current and frequent
floods.</p>

<p>The Correntino has not yet, however, developed much
commercial enterprise. His cattle still show the native
long horned and limbed characteristics of wilder days and
he himself seems to find it less trouble to get tobacco, <i lang="es">mate</i>,
sugar, coffee and many other things from Brazil or Paraguay
than to grow and manufacture them himself; as he could
do easily and profitably. Much of his nature is Indian; to
be modified in time by the overwhelming forces of civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>One cannot leave Corrientes without mention of the lake
<span class="smcap">Iberá</span> in the North of the Province, a vast natural hollow
filled with water, the surface of which is in many parts
covered so solidly with interlaced bamboos, grasses and
aquatic plants as to enable one to walk on it as if on a huge
raft. There has been much talk of reclaiming the land by
draining Lake Iberá, a task which owing to the gradients of
the surrounding lands would not present great difficulties;
if so be that the lake is not connected by subterranean
channels with the Rivers Paraná and Upper Uruguay, as
there are several reasons to suppose it may be.</p>

<p>The islands of this lake form a perfect zoological garden
of animals and reptiles long since practically extinct in the
surrounding country; among which are Jaguars, Alligators
and Boa Constrictors.</p>

<p>The present writer remembers an interesting if somewhat
terrifying collection of such and other wild specimens being
cast up a little more than a decade ago on the river shores of
the Province of Buenos Aires, near to the Federal Capital,
by the swollen waters of the Paraná during extraordinary
floods. These creatures were washed down clinging to trunks
of trees and islets of intertwined vegetation which had been
torn away by the force of the waters. It is safe to assume
that they were much more terrified than were even the
peaceable inhabitants of the places where they involuntarily
landed.</p>

<p>The illustrious General San Martin was a Correntino, born
in what was once called Yapeyú, now an important Live
Stock centre and renamed after him.</p>

<p>A monument has also been erected there to his memory, a
patriotic embellishment which no Argentine township, however,
is without.</p>

<h3>SAN LUIS</h3>

<p>This Province is bounded on the North by the Province
of La Rioja, on the West by the Provinces of San Juan and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Mendoza, on the East by the Province of Córdoba and on the
South by the Territory of the Pampa Central.</p>

<p>Until the coming of Alfalfa, San Luis was chiefly interesting
for its mineral possibilities. Even now, after Salta and
Jujuy, it is the most sparsely populated of the Argentine
Provinces. Nevertheless, it now has large areas under
wheat; and sandy salty tracts which not long ago, in common
with similar tracts in the West of the Province of Buenos
Aires and in the Territory of the Pampa Central, were
looked on as useless deserts, are covered with an extraordinarily
luxuriant growth of lucerne. The salty nature
of the soil is favourable to this valuable forage plant, and
its tap roots find their way easily through the sandy
surface to the closely adjacent damp subsoil and surface
waters.</p>

<p>Irrigation is destined to play an important rôle in other
parts of San Luis.</p>

<p>At present this Province runs Santa Fé very close in
point of number of Live Stock; though the general average
of quality is a good way behind that found in the “home”
Provinces or Córdoba.</p>

<p>San Luis cultivates an appreciable quantity of good
table grapes, and, as is noticed in another chapter, also
produces some wine.</p>

<p>The Province is intersected in its North and Central parts
by four lines of the Buenos Aires Pacific Railway and in the
South by two of the Buenos Aires Western Railway.</p>

<p>It is evident that the mineral deposits of San Luis were
worked in the prehistoric days prior to the Spanish Conquest,
but little has been done to exploit them in modern times
except as regards the beautiful green marble, commonly
called Brazilian Onyx, large quantities of which are exported.
Gold mining has been attempted in modern times,
but without as yet any very appreciable results. San Luis,
however, produces a certain regular supply of Wolfram.</p>

<p>The people of San Luis are frequently accused of indolence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Certainly the Province is not a wealthy one, nor do its
inhabitants appear over alert to seize the opportunities
which nature and modern methods combined now offer them.</p>

<h3>SANTIAGO DEL ESTERO</h3>

<p>This Province is bounded on the North by the Province of
Salta and the National Territory of Formosa, on the West by
the Province of Tucumán and Catamarca, on the East by the
National Territory of the Chaco and the Province of Santa
Fé and on the South by the Province of Córdoba.</p>

<p>Irrigation has led to a considerable development of wheat-growing
in this Province and to irrigation it must chiefly
owe its future progress; for, in its almost tropical climate,
rain only falls in the summer months and usually is absorbed
almost as soon as it falls by a sandy and dusty soil.</p>

<p>The average temperature of Santiago del Estero is highly
favourable to maize, but, here again, the question of water
supply arises, only to be met by artificial means. Already
principal and subsidiary irrigation canals have been constructed
in the areas through which pass the two rivers of
the Province, the Dulce and the Saladillo, and further works
of the kind are in active contemplation.</p>

<p>The salt sandy soil of much of this Province has been
found as favourable to Alfalfa as such soil is elsewhere when
there is water not far down or at least a damp subsoil. So
that Santiago boasts of an already large and an increasing
number of <i lang="es">Alfalfares</i>, as lucerne-bearing lands are called.
The chief industries of the North of this Province are in
connection with its forestal products, the cutting and rough
trimming of Quebracho wood, firewood and charcoal burning.
The people engaged in these occupations are mostly totally
uneducated and are unacquainted with any of the higher
developments of civilization. They are indeed in some
respects similar to the stock-riding Gaucho of the past
in other provinces, but without the intelligence he displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
within the limits of his punctilious observance of
custom.</p>

<p>Dancing, card-playing and drinking are the only amenities
of life known to the wood-cutters of Santiago del Estero,
unless fighting be added as a pendant to, and consequence
of, the last-named pastime of alcoholic indulgence. Like all
<span class="smcap">Gauchos</span>, however, they are really only dangerous to one
another in this regard, a stranger being treated by them with
all the good-humoured courtesy at their command.</p>

<p>The Santagueños of the forests have been singled out by
one very observant and reliable writer on South American
countries, Monsieur Paul Walle,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> as having superstitious
faith in “Curanderos” or quack doctors, people of their own
class. They do indeed show a perfectly childlike faith in
quack nostrums; but in this, leave must be taken to say,
they are by no means alone among the rural populations of
the River Plate. The present writer has known the queerest
kinds of remedies believed in implicitly and practised even
in that hub of progress, the Province of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Active official efforts have for some time been devoted to
the weeding out of <span class="smcap">Curanderos</span> and <span class="smcap">Curanderas</span>; but, as
in the mediæval days of England, they are still sought out,
more or less secretly, by neighbours who have infinitely
more faith in their “cures” than they would have in the
treatment of whole Colleges of Physicians.</p>

<p>Possibly these quacks often do cure by suggestion. The
writer has, for instance, heard strong oral evidence of the
efficacy for toothache of expectorating into the mouth of a
frog, caught at a certain hour of the night. There could be
no doubt about it. Many people have been entirely relieved
from pain by that simple expedient. The rather revolting
rite performed, the frog must be set at liberty and carries
away the pain with it!</p>

<p>Much of this quackery is relatively harmless, but much of
it is also highly dangerous, not only to the actual patient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
but to the community in general; as preventing the former
from seeking orthodox treatment which, while really curing
him, would at the same time prevent the spread of infectious
and contagious disease.</p>

<p>To sum up, Santiago del Estero undoubtedly has a rich
future before it, dependent chiefly on irrigation.</p>

<h3>TUCUMÁN</h3>

<p>This Province is bounded on the North by the Province of
Salta, on the West and South by the Province of Catamarca
and on the East by the Province of Santiago del Estero.</p>

<p>It has the smallest superficial area of all the Argentine
Provinces; being less than one-eleventh the size of Buenos
Aires and less than one-fifth that of Santiago del Estero.</p>

<p>It, however, is a very important Province, because it produces
over 90% of the whole sugar output of the Republic.
It also grows an appreciable quantity of maize, but when, in
Argentina, one says Tucumán one is almost invariably
thought to be about to speak of sugar.</p>

<p>It always has been <em>the</em> sugar-producing area of the River
Plate Territories; from the time of the Jesuit Missionaries,
say, about the middle of the eighteenth century. The first
modern sugar-manufacturing machinery was set up in
Tucumán in 1879.</p>

<p>The whole matter of the Argentine Sugar industry was for
long hedged about with fiscal and other questions and a
great sensitiveness on the part of the growers and refiners
in regard to their discussion. That a certain number of
companies divided the whole of the industry between them
was undoubted fact, as was the equally obvious one that they
carried on business in accordance rather with their ideas of
their own commercial interests than in any larger or more
philanthropic spirit. Sugar is still much dearer for the
Argentine consumer than there seems any good reason for.
Special legislature has operated until recently as an exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
protection to this industry, thus maintaining, as was
vehemently urged in many quarters, a monopoly, to the
extent of being relieved of any foreign competition, in the
hands of the Tucumán Companies who conducted their
affairs in a mutually friendly fashion.</p>

<p>Their opponents throughout the country said that Tucumán
(the sugar interests there are still inseparably connected
with Provincial politics and politicians) not only waxed fat
at the public expense, but did so by means and methods
opposed to the public interest. Certainly legislature offered
temptation to artificial limitation of output, and it was
chiefly in regard to this—burning of productive cane-fields
and so forth—that the sugar companies long stood accused.</p>

<p>On whichever side the balance of the arguments for or
against the doings of the Tucumán sugar industry may have
lain it may be safely asserted that no political influence can
nowadays continue to bolster up commercial malpractices of
any magnitude in Argentina. The National Government
has already seen and will see to it that no hole-in-the-corner
Provincial politics shall interfere with the National welfare
and credit. Influence, although still powerful in minor
matters, can no longer suffice to avoid any matter of public
importance being exposed to examination by the full light
of day.</p>

<p>Tucumán is well aware of this, and therefore can be relied
on, and indeed must be, to trim her sails to the healthy wind
by which the course of the Republic is now determined.</p>

<p>It is only fair to add that the Tucumán Sugar Companies’
argument in their own defence to the suggestion of an
inequitable monopoly exercised by them is, in effect, “Well,
supposing that we have been making very large profits of
late years, we have borne the brunt of hard times for many
more, before the industry had developed to its present extent
and before we were able to obtain assistance or even practical
encouragement from the State. And besides, were we wrong
in making hay whilst the sun shone? Any day may bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
us competition in the shape of the rise of new cane-fields
in other Northern districts of this fertile Republic.”</p>

<p>This is at least sympathetic if not strictly legitimate
reasoning.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Province of Tucumán has grown
prosperous, and the employment of more enlightened
methods of conducting all branches of its sugar industry
has recently resulted in enhanced prosperity coupled with a
largely increased output. The City of Tucumán, its Capital,
one of the pleasantest and most progressive towns in Argentina,
has no less than five different railway stations pertaining
to lines connecting it with Buenos Aires (of which the
Central Argentine is the most direct) and local systems.</p>

<p>The vegetation of the Plazas and Boulevards of the
City is subtropical and social demands have provided
Tucumán with an ornate Casino connected with a vast
modern Hotel and theatre. Electric light and tramways
abound in its orange-flower scented streets and public
places, among which must now be counted a huge Park
designed to celebrate the 1910 centenary. A special building
enshrines the historic room in which the Declaration of
Independence was signed.</p>

<p>Buildings of the Colonial period still exist in Tucumán
and its outskirts, but the dominant tendency is towards
modernity in architecture and all else. The City is picturesquely
situated in a valley among hills which appear to
surround it and give it a curious appearance of having, with
its Casino, brilliantly lit avenues and gardens and its
luxuriant vegetation, sprung into existence as a scene on
some vast stage.</p>

<p>It has a winter season of ever-growing social importance;
during which the great Sugar Families occupy their palatial
villas and display dark beauty and grace to the music of
the band in the Plaza Independencia and at the Casino and
Theatre.</p>

<p>Irrigation is easily attained over the most part of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Province, from the Dulce River and its many tributaries as
well as from several other streams.</p>

<p>Tucumán grows some wheat, but not much, its principal
crops (after, of course, sugar) being maize and alfalfa.</p>

<p>It has comparatively little live stock, owing largely to the
general humidity of its soil. It has, however, an exceptionally
large aggregate of population for its size in comparison
with other Provinces.</p>

<p>Parts of Tucumán are forest, part mountainous with peaks
clad in everlasting snow from which accumulate innumerable
turbulent mountain streams. For picturesque and varied
scenery of almost every kind Tucumán is perhaps preeminent
in the Republic. Its valleys are with very few
exceptions fertile and well watered.</p>

<p>This Province has several fairly important towns situated
on the railways which traverse its central and southern
districts.</p>

<h3>CATAMARCA</h3>

<p>This Province is bounded on the North by that of Salta
and the National Territory of Los Andes, on the West by
Chile, on the South by the Provinces of La Rioja and Córdoba
and on the East by those of Santiago del Estero and Tucumán.
As can be imagined from its geographical situation, it produces
a certain quantity of maize and, given advantages, to
be mentioned later, undoubtedly could produce a great deal
more. As yet it is sparsely populated, and the influence of
progress is only just being forced upon it by a paternal
National Government which not only has irrigation schemes
in hand, but has already constructed a railway—the North
Argentina—one of the new Government lines, to afford
transport for the future wealth of this hitherto dormant
Province. Irrigation, transport and fresh elements and
methods of labour are the three requisites for Catamarca’s
advancement. She has plenty of what is easily convertible
into fertile soil; and, without doubt, rich mineral deposits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Both of these resources would long ago have been advantageously
exploited had the population of the Argentine
Republic attained larger figures than as yet represent it.</p>

<p>Catamarca is mountainous over a large portion of its
area, but this area is interspersed with very fertile valleys
and possesses a vast tableland, called the <span class="smcap">Campo del
Pucara</span>. In a hollow of this tableland is the capital city of
Catamarca.</p>

<p>There are plenty of mountain streams from which to
irrigate the greater portion of the soil of this Province, and
also a water bed not far from the surface from which irrigation
could be obtained. At present—most of the surface
soil being extremely loose and porous—the water brought
down by the mountain streams is immediately absorbed, and
the climate generally is dry. The mean temperature
naturally varies according to altitude, but the lower valleys
are very hot in summer-time.</p>

<p>The City of Catamarca is still a veritable sleepy hollow,
poor and indolent, but picturesque with the gardens and
orange and other orchards of Colonial times.</p>

<p>The population of this Province is mostly of mixed
Spanish and Indian origin; as indeed is that of practically
all the northern outlying Provinces and Territories of the
Republic.</p>

<p>The needs of these people are few, and they continue in a
lethargic condition of conservative content. One district,
however, of Catamarca—Andalgalá—boasts of an aristocracy
of pure Spanish blood, resident since the early days of the
Conquest.</p>

<p>At present all the best brains of Catamarca find their way
to Buenos Aires; in despair of the small scope, and even
opposition to any suggestion of innovation, offered by their
native Province. Still, Nature in Catamarca, as elsewhere
throughout Argentina, only awaits the call of man to respond
with rich gifts.</p>

<p>There is no doubt about the existence of valuable mineral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
deposits, silver, copper and especially tin, in Catamarca.
The chief obstacle to the due exploitation of these up to the
present has been the difficulty and cost of transport. The
railway should soon, however, render the working of these
mines profitable on a much larger scale than hitherto has
been commercially possible.</p>

<h3>LA RIOJA</h3>

<p>This Province is bounded on the North and North-East
by the Province of Catamarca, on the West and South-West
by Chile and the Province of San Juan, on the South by the
Province of San Luis, and on the East by Catamarca, again,
and the Province of Córdoba.</p>

<p>La Rioja is another outlying Province of which can be
said, as of so many as yet comparatively unproductive parts
of Argentina, that water, labour and transport alone are
needed to make them rich far beyond any dreams of avarice
which have yet occupied the minds of their few and easy-going
inhabitants. Maize flourishes in this hot, dry climate,
as do all manner of subtropical and even tropical fruits,
including dates, wherever water is available. Even wheat
grows splendidly in some districts, given irrigation. And,
as in many other salty and saltpetre-impregnated soils,
there are large areas in La Rioja highly favourable to the
growth of Alfalfa.</p>

<p>At present this Province is more sparsely populated than
any other in the Republic except Jujuy, but it boasts of a
fair number of (mostly native) cattle. As in all the Andine
Provinces and Territories there is a relatively considerable
export trade of cattle on the hoof to Chile.</p>

<p>La Rioja produces some wine, and at some future date
will, no doubt, produce more, in view of the advantages for
vine culture of its soil in many parts and its warm, dry
climate. At present the wine of La Rioja is mostly consumed
in the province itself and the immediately neighbouring
Provinces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Large irrigating works are in progress, and more are
under consideration by the National Government for
the development of the agricultural industries of this
Province.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with or possibly before such development
will have been able, on account of lack of population,
to assume any very notable progress, one may reasonably
expect to see a largely increased activity in the exploitation
of La Rioja’s mineral wealth (apparently much greater than
that of Catamarca) by reason of the enormously increased
facilities for transport afforded by the National North
Argentine Railway. La Rioja has rich deposits of silver,
copper, nickel, tin, cobalt, topaz and many beautiful kinds
of marble.</p>

<p>The mining district best known at present is that of La
Famatina; from which a cable-way of 35 kilometres in
length was constructed by the National Government some
years ago to connect the hillside mines with the rail-head at
Chilecito.</p>

<p>La Rioja has, however, many other evidently rich mineral
areas, including some containing quartz and alluvial gold.
The unsystematic exploitation of these has as yet given but
small satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The city of La Rioja, the Capital, is still in a state of
arrested development, similarly with Catamarca, only even
more so. It has not yet experienced sufficient prosperity to
enable it to recover from the paralysing effects of the civil
disturbances which raged in and around it for very many
years after the overthrow of the Spanish rule. The people,
the great majority of whom have a large admixture of native
Indian blood, are, however, of a rather more lively and
energetic disposition than their Catamarcan neighbours.
This is no doubt due to a difference in their racial origin; the
Indian ancestors of the natives of La Rioja having apparently
belonged to tribes which in bygone times inhabited,
or were in close relations with those which inhabited, Peru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and thus possibly absorbed something of the Inca civilization.</p>

<p>The surface of La Rioja has two general aspects; one
part is broken and mountainous and the other an immense
plain, needing, as has been said, only labour and irrigation
to yield rich agricultural results. The one important river
of the Province is the Bermejo. The mineral wealth of this
Province lies almost if not entirely exclusively, in its mountainous
districts.</p>

<h3>JUJUY</h3>

<p>Jujuy has its very special interest for the Anglo-Saxon
race, since it affords, in the history of the Leach family, a
striking example of the colonizing enterprise and patience of
that race.</p>

<p>Look at the position of Jujuy on the map and imagine
what colonizing must have been like in the middle of last
century when the brothers Leach first settled in what has
since become a Province, but then was a wild district
inhabited by native Indians.</p>

<p>One of the brothers, especially, Mr. Walter Leach, seems
to have exercised a peculiar and highly beneficial influence
over these people, and managed to introduce ideas of industry
and gradual civilization to tribes whose former lives
had been mostly occupied with warfare one with another.</p>

<p>Now we may almost say that “Leach” is synonymous
with “<span class="smcap">Jujuy</span>” and vice versa, and enterprises initiated by
this family now embrace all branches of industry of which
the Province is yet capable, including large sugar plantations
and machinery. Now, the National Central Northern
Argentine Railway connects Jujuy with the outer world,
but before its advent it was indeed a far-off land to be
reached only after many weeks’ arduous journeying. Jujuy
is the most distant and, after Tucumán, the smallest Province
of the Republic.</p>

<p>It is bounded on the North and North-West by Bolivia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
on the West by the National Territory of Los Andes and on
the South and East by the Province of Salta.</p>

<p>Jujuy produces not inconsiderable quantities of wheat,
maize, barley and alfalfa and, as has been said, sugar.</p>

<p>In the North it has a number of salt lakes, which are
exploited commercially, as also are some deposits of borax.</p>

<p>The climate of Jujuy is very varied, according to altitude,
but in general is much more temperate than the actual latitude
of the Province would lead one to suppose. There is
always a considerable rainfall during hot weather. Its chief
river is the Rio Grande de Humahuaca, a tributary of the
Bermejo, which coming from the North curves in a semicircle
through the Central and South-Eastern parts of the
Province.</p>

<p>Jujuy, with its broken surface, claims rivalry with
Tucumán as the most picturesque of the Argentine Provinces.
In some of its southern districts the vegetation is tropical.
In the North-West there is a high tableland much of which
is dry and practically desert, interspersed with fertile valleys.</p>

<p>In the South of the Province the population is of mixed
racial origin with a very large element of native Indian
blood. In the North it is practically pure Indian. The
native Humahuaca dialect is preponderant everywhere,
even in Spanish as spoken there. In the North there is
little or no pretension to speak anything but Humahuaca.</p>

<p>The Capital, however, the City of Jujuy, was, strangely
enough, the first Argentine town to have its streets paved.
It was the scene of the assassination of General Lavalle, one
of the heroes of the Wars of Independence, and possesses
the original flag of General Belgrano, the blue and white
chosen by him for the nascent Republic, and ever since
retained by it. Later the National Colours and those of
Uruguay (a slightly different arrangement of the same blue
and white) were officially emblazoned with the golden “Sun
of May”; the 25th of May, 1810, being the date of the
Declaration of Independence from the rule of Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>As has been mentioned above, most of such prosperity as
Jujuy as yet possesses is due to the patient energy of the
Leach family. Such administrative and fiscal discredit as
attaches to the Province is, on the other hand, due to the
native element among its politicians. These evils inevitably
must soon be swept away by the advance of civilized ideas
and necessity for better management by public authority.
The mass of the population will, no doubt, continue to live
in its own long-accustomed primitive fashion.</p>

<p>It hardly contains the racial elements of rapid advance
towards a much higher civilization.</p>

<p>Future immigration must be relied on to do much to
develop Jujuy’s natural resources.</p>

<p>At present a certain amount of rather primitive, and
some contraband, export and import trade is done with
Bolivia in the Northern parts of the Province.</p>

<p>Jujuy is poor in Live Stock even of the native kinds.</p>

<h3>SALTA</h3>

<p>With Salta we complete the list of the less important
outlying Argentine Provinces.</p>

<p>Like Jujuy, it is bounded on the North by Bolivia, on the
West by Jujuy and the National Territory of Los Andes, on
the South by Tucumán and Santiago del Estero, and on the
East by the National Territory of Formosa.</p>

<p>Salta is indeed historic ground; so full of reminiscence of
the Wars of Independence that it may almost be called the
cradle of the Republic. It was also in Salta that Jabez
Balfour was at length taken into custody, after a long
struggle for an extradition treaty between Great Britain
and Argentina.</p>

<p>The writer is well acquainted with a gentleman, since then
become a prominent figure in the railway world of the River
Plate, who “specially” drove the engine of the train which
brought Balfour down to civilization and captivity. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
prisoner had money which he had spent freely among his
new neighbours, and attempts at rescue were expected. So
the train rushed on its downward course with a velocity to
which the then permanent way and rails were totally unaccustomed,
but, as all the world was soon made aware,
arrived at its destination without accident.</p>

<p>The prisoner had been the victim of his own luxurious
habits, for he had grown so fat that it was impossible to
convey him through frontier mountain passes into Bolivia,
as his friends had intended and as would have been possible,
in point of time, to do before the expected warrant for his
arrest could have found its way into the not too willing
hands of the local authorities.</p>

<p>Until his recent death, the present generation had scarcely
heard of Jabez Balfour. Yet he was widely celebrated in
contemporaneous popular song as “The man who broke the
Bank at Monte Carlo.”</p>

<p>In Salta is still to be found a much more really interesting
personage in the <span class="smcap">Gaucho</span>, the Cavaliere Rusticano of the
River Plate and the hero of all its earlier poetry and romance.
He of the guitar-accompanied improvised verse, of the quick
flashing knife and equally quick <span class="smcap">Rebenque</span>.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> He was no
small element in the victories won over the Spanish soldiery
nor in the long years of civil war which followed Independence.
He is still in Salta; one of the last parts of the Republic in
which he can be found. Comparatively uncontaminated by
the encroachments of the drab uniformity of civilization.</p>

<p>He remains romantic and brutal, chivalrous and
treacherous, hospitable and quick to resent the mere implication
of an insult. Still a cattle herd adept with lazo
or <i lang="es">boleadora</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> a nomad ever seeking fresh fields and pastures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
new within the limits of his native territory. Give him a
uniform he is a very useful soldier, and a fair military policeman,
save for his rather erratic fits of truculence. For the
rest no good at all outside of the few spheres mapped out
for him by the limitation of his own strongly marked
individuality. But he will always know again an animal
he has once seen, and will track out a lost sheep across a
very maze of confused spoor.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Gibson<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> has written of the gaucho with true
feeling and appreciation in the following words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Skilled in horsemanship, quick of hand and of eye; in his
beginnings the Arab and nomad of the plains; indifferent of
his neighbour’s life, for his own he carried in his hand to risk at
the first hazard, yet “loyal to his own law” even in his most
lawless exploits—the gaucho of the Pampa constitutes the
genuine emblem of the Argentine genius. He is the materialized
expression of the spirit of the vast and lonely plain. “Bearing
allegiance to neither King nor thing,” as Azara writes, he followed
the fate of the live stock of the colony; when the cattle escaped
control he too declared himself free, running wild and beyond
the pale of even nominal domestication. The Pampa was his
home, and in his ears the breeze moving over the plains whispered
to him of liberty. To colonial rule succeeded the new
order of Independence, and the gaucho, inured by his style of
living to the stress of weather and to the struggle with savage
animals, became the right hand of the petty chiefs of party
faction, ever joining the side in conflict with the ruling power.
The words law and order signified for him oppression and servitude,
and he became the declared enemy of all authority. But
with all his faults the gaucho, in his own element, mounted on
his beloved horse, with lazo secured to the back of his saddle and
his <i lang="es">boleadora</i> hanging from his waist, was the henchman beyond
price for the work of the old estancia, knowing how to dominate
and domesticate the savage herds and droves of wild mares.
In all that he has seemingly been modified by the progress of
the times, he has remained unmodified in his spirit which is the
essential manifestation of his climate and of his habit. The
nomad gaucho of the colonial period converted into the loyal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
gaucho of the estancia, the man with no other belongings than
his horses and the silver clasp and buttons hanging at his belt
to whom the breeder entrusted all his herds, and the grazier
the money wherewith to buy the droves of bullocks, without for
one moment thinking, either the one or the other, that he would
neglect his charges or fail to render account to the uttermost
farthing committed to his care. Alike loyal and venturesome in
the fulfilment of his duties, and kindly and hospitable in his
lowly home life, he is the hero of the rural romance of the Pampa.
Not without regret and tender reminiscences must we take farewell
of a period of pastoral life, from whose remembrance all the
hardships and bitterness have disappeared, only leaving to us
the recollection of that patriarchal and wholesome life which the
late Hernandez has so skilfully depicted in the picturesque
language of the gaucho who tells his story by the fitful light of
the fire on the kitchen hearth while his fingers caress the melancholy
strings of the guitar.</p>

<p>And now approaches the new era of railways, of fenced-in
paddocks, of ingenious drafting gates and all the mechanical
entourage of the modern pastoral industry. The gaucho, like
Othello, is without an occupation, but the spirit which in divers
forms and epochs has characterized him shall not die. It is the
native spirit of the Argentine genius which enters the immigrant
ere for long he has settled in the land and which inspires the sons
born to him in this country; it is the instinct of independence
and individuality engendered by the free air of a rural life, and
which is the antithesis of the dependent spirit symbolized in city
life by socialism.</p>

</div>

<p>Salta is a large, sparsely populated Province, the inhabitants
of which outside the circle of its aristocratic
families, are composed of our friend the <span class="smcap">Gaucho</span> and his
families and the <span class="smcap">Coya</span> Indians. These last, cowboys and
shepherds, are much more unpleasant people; morose,
avaricious in their necessarily small way, and full of sullen
duplicity. Their only obvious virtue is their devoted
attachment to the small allotments of land they can call
their own. This solitary virtue does not, however, make
them any the pleasanter to strangers; all of whom indiscriminately
they regard as possible enemies come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
rob them of their rights in some mysterious way or
other.</p>

<p>Naturally, with such a population and on account of its
distance from the great commercial centres of the Republic,
Salta is not yet very far on the road to any great or settled
prosperity.</p>

<p>It has some sugar plantations, cultivates some tobacco
and makes some wine, but with its many generally well-watered
and easily irrigable large areas of rich soil it could
easily, and of course eventually will, progress.</p>

<p>It could grow a great deal more maize and alfalfa than it
does, and could carry much more and better live stock than
it yet troubles to do.</p>

<p>It produces some fruit and could produce all sorts of
much choicer kinds in great variety; also potatoes, cotton
and, as experts affirm, excellent coffee.</p>

<p>Of course there are here the old difficulties of irrigation,
in some places, cost of transport and lack of intelligent
labour. The first two are rapidly being overcome by the
National Government, the last must be looked for overseas.
The Gaucho and the Coya not only are not sufficiently
numerous for Salta’s future needs, but (alas for the
romance of the former!) they must be classed amongst
the doomed unfit; to be merged in or overwhelmed by the
march of modernity.</p>

<p>The aspect of Salta, like that of most of the northern
Provinces and Territories, is varied. Mountain and low
valley, broad plain and forest, deep river and rushing
stream all alternate and give picturesqueness and diversity
of climate. Goats, mules and sufficient horses for existing
local needs are to be found here as in the neighbouring
Provinces; all of which are justly famous for products, the
mention of which must on no account be overlooked, the
native cloths and <span class="smcapuc">PONCHOS</span>, hand-woven of vicuna and guanaco
wool. Soft, warm and durable, these cloths are highly and
justly valued in the more civilized regions of the River Plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The manufacture of them dates from times which are
prehistoric in America.</p>

<p>The forests of Salta contain a great quantity of Quebracho
of excellent quality, and there are several indigenous
creepers of caoutchouc-bearing kinds. This latter has
as yet been little exploited, and then only in an extremely
primitive manner.</p>

<p>Salta boasts a large hydropathic establishment in connection
with the hot mineral springs of Rosario de la
Frontera.</p>

<p>Salta, the Capital, is another of the old Colonial cities,
amid the low houses of which fine new public buildings
occur incongruously; iconoclastic. It has also a zoological
garden which, wisely, contains many interesting specimens
of local fauna, fine, luxuriantly planted public gardens and
Plazas and an excellent Police Band.</p>

<p>In the oligarchic days of only a very few years ago the
police forces of these outlying Provinces were extremely
important political instruments. Under the Constitution
the Provinces cannot raise or maintain independent soldiery;
but who could say them nay if the exigencies of an uncultured
population necessitated a large police force armed
with Mausers?—to ensure due obedience to the orders of
and agreement with the policy of the Provincial powers that
were.</p>

<p>There are few commercial centres in Salta having populations
sufficient to give them importance as towns. Metan
is the largest, and after it come Cafayate, Campo Santo and
Rosario de la Frontera, which, as has been said, is noted
for its hot springs.</p>

<h3>MENDOZA</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus6">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RUINS OF JESUIT BUILDINGS: MENDOZA, ARGENTINA</p>
</div>

<p>This is one of the richer Provinces on account of its
vines and the large wine-making industry. Similarly with
Tucumán and Sugar, one may say that Mendoza and Wine
are in Argentina practically synonymous; this observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
also applies to its neighbour, San Juan, the second great
wine-producing Province. Indeed it is quite common—very
common indeed, in fact—to say of a person who
shows signs of being under alcoholic influence that he is
“Entre San Juan y Mendoza” (between San Juan and
Mendoza).</p>

<p>Besides those of its vines, the greatest agricultural products
of Mendoza are alfalfa, grown over very considerable
areas of salt-impregnated soil, and a much smaller proportion
of maize.</p>

<p>The population of Mendoza is small and the number of
its live stock very little larger: although in point of superficial
area Mendoza ranks third (after Buenos Aires and
Córdoba) among the Argentine Provinces. It is only fair,
however, to add that much of the Western Area of Mendoza
is very mountainous, since it includes a long stretch of the
Eastern side of the Andes.</p>

<p>This Province is bounded on the North by that of San
Juan, on the West by Chile, on the South by the National
Territories of Neuquen and the Pampa Central, and on the
East by the Province of San Luis.</p>

<p>Its department of San Rafael is a very large one, larger
indeed than the whole of the rest of the Province put
together; in it is found the greatest agricultural activity,
including the great alfalfa fields. The Mendoza cattle are
of all kinds and varieties, little attention having been yet,
generally, given to the science of cross-breeding. It, however,
exports numbers of cattle to Chile, either by way of
mountain passes or the Transandine Railway; but a great
many of these have been bred in neighbouring Provinces
and sent to Mendoza for a fattening period before exportation.</p>

<p>Irrigation is a great feature of Mendoza, which was the
first Province to receive any notable attention in this regard.
Now, if we except, perhaps, the great irrigation works and
schemes already well advanced in the National Territories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of Neuquen and the Rio Negro, Mendoza has, with San Juan,
the largest and most comprehensive systems (both existing
and in advanced stages of consideration) in the whole
Republic.</p>

<p>The fall of the mountain rivers and the eastward drop of
the whole surface of the Province makes irrigation here a
comparatively easy task, while the natural fertility of the
soil quickly and richly repays the initial cost and upkeep of
reservoirs and canals. One menace there is which hangs
ever over Mendoza, that of volcanic eruptions. The whole
of its Capital was completely destroyed as recently as 1861.
The city has, however, been rebuilt on its former site, a sort
of shelf of land situated on the spring of the great Andine
range. Gradually the loosely built low adobe houses have
been and are still being replaced in the New Town by
several-storied buildings of solid masonry; courage growing
as the date of the last great earthquake grows more remote.
Still slight shocks are of frequent occurrence in the Capital
and elsewhere in this Province.</p>

<p>The City of Mendoza is rich in public gardens and avenues
filled with luxuriantly umbrageous vegetation and has, of
course (what self-respecting Argentine town has them not?),
electric light and trams; but its just pride is the great
West Park, situate on another level shelf of land projecting
from the foot of the Cordillera on a higher level than that
on which the City is built.</p>

<p>This Park has a sheet of water of almost a mile in length
by some seventy-five yards broad, in which are ornamental
islets and on which regattas are held. For these festal
occasions there is a huge stone grand stand at one end of
the water. The Park has many magnificent electric-lighted
avenues lined with trees of majestic proportions, and all
over it are gardens of subtropical shrubs and plants. Within
its great bronze gates are also a zoological and a, specifically,
botanical garden.</p>

<p>With all this, if Mendoza has drawn somewhat on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
future to foot the bill of its many embellishments, it has
done no more than many other cities of the still new South
American countries, and with more immediate prospect of
justification for its expenditure than have several others.
What Mendoza has got to do now is to create an export
trade for its wines, on the condition precedent that it
manufacture wines that will keep and will improve with
keeping. Otherwise with increased irrigation it may run the
risk of over-production, since the home consumption is as
yet a limited one. The increase of the population of the
River Plate countries is, as we have seen, still slow, and
outside the towns very little wine is drunk by the majority
of the people except on special and rare occasions; mate
sufficing for their habits and needs.</p>

<p>Mendoza sends large quantities of table-grapes and other
fruit to Buenos Aires, and hopes one day to send them overseas.
This latter consideration depends greatly on the
adoption of improved methods of picking and packing,
matters to which the management of the Buenos Aires
Pacific Railway has given much practical attention. Care
in such details is, however, but little in the Argentine nature
generally, and even in a less degree in that of the strong
mixture of Indian blood which marks the working classes
of Mendoza, as it does in all except the littoral Provinces.
Very good canned peaches come from the Mendoza
factories and are in large demand throughout the Republic.</p>

<p>Coal and petroleum have both been found in the Province,
but further working tests are needed before their probable
commercial value can be ascertained.</p>

<p>From the City of Mendoza the Buenos Aires Pacific
Railway (familiarly B.A.P.) strikes upward to where it
passes through the Transandine tunnel; on the Mendoza
side of which is the famous Puente del Inca (the Inca’s
bridge), a vast block of stone which, lying across a ravine,
makes a natural bridge, recalling the giant-built palace of
the old Norse Gods. Here are also some hot mineral springs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
celebrated for treatment of rheumatism; to which treatment
the dry, rarefied mountain air perhaps contributes
its less recognized quota.</p>

<h3>SAN JUAN</h3>

<p>This Province is bounded on the North and East by the
Province of La Rioja, on the West by Chile, and on the South
and South-East by the Provinces of Mendoza and San Luis
respectively.</p>

<p>Of all the Argentine Provinces San Juan has shown itself,
until very recent times indeed, probably the most recalcitrant
towards financial orderliness. A repeated <i lang="la">non
possumus</i> was the only answer its inertness returned to the
many periodical fulminations and menaces of the National
Government in respect of its treasury bonds or depreciated
Provincial paper money. So depreciated, in fact, that it
was worth nothing at all outside the Province itself, and was
by no means welcome, although legal, tender within its
boundaries.</p>

<p>San Juan pleaded that it could not call this paper in
since it had nothing with which to replace it—all the little
National money it got for its wines and other produce went
immediately back to Buenos Aires again for necessary
purchases.</p>

<p>The National Government insisted that San Juan <em>must</em>
remove the disgrace from its financial escutcheon or all sorts
of things would happen. San Juan regretted deeply and
asked for time. In the meanwhile it contrived to raise
another of those loans, without much more than a shadow
of adequate security or provision, which long have been the
nightmare of the National Government, and it still kept on
using its depreciated notes. So, and in many other ways
for long, very long, did San Juan wrestle, successfully
according to its lights, with the spirit of progress until
irrigation, fostered by the National Government, came to
the aid of the latter in a way there was no denying.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus9">
<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="400" height="525" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PUENTE DEL INCA; MENDOZA, ARGENTINA</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>San Juan <em>had</em> to become more prosperous and to begin
to pay its way in respectable fashion. It evidently did not
in the least want to do so, but it could not any longer see
any way by which it could avoid recognition of its just
liabilities. Thus are the good old times of this Province
vanishing; the good old times which made sufficient
provision for an aristocratic oligarchy and in which vassals
had no opportunity of acquiring luxurious tastes.</p>

<p>First the railway, slow in this case, however, in its usually
tonic effects and then irrigation, which poured water on
to a naturally very fertile soil, brought it about that one
day San Juan woke up to find itself faced with financial
responsibility.</p>

<p>People from the littoral and even from overseas came and
bought land and paid good prices in hard cash for it and then
planted vines of new, productive kinds; trimmed them in
new, productive ways; and made better wine out of them
than San Juan had ever deemed at all necessary. Other
people planted wheat and alfalfa, and even troubled to grow
more maize than there had been before. In fact, if ever
a Province had greatness thrust upon it in a bewilderingly
short space of time it was San Juan. People are even
prospecting and actually exploiting its long-latent mineral
wealth, looking for and finding deposits of gold, silver,
copper, iron, zinc, lead, sulphur, alum, mica, rock salt,
lignite and marble.</p>

<p>The exploitation of many of these has not yet attained
any very great commercial importance,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> but that of others
has already done so, and all the companies concerned have
brought money into the Province and pay wages to many
native workers. All this troublesomeness tends to curtail
the daily siesta, but a consequent bundle of full-value
national dollars operates as a consolation to even the most
conscientious observer of traditional custom. The next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
generation of San Juan inhabitants will doubtless be as wide
awake as their neighbours, and strikes may take the place
of old-time rebellion to the orders of patriarchal overlords;
while the latter will be put to it to work their
ancestral lands intelligently in order to maintain the due
measure of their proper dignity.</p>

<p>Not only has the National Government fostered large
systems of irrigation in and given irrigation to this Province,
but it has also run a railway connecting the City of San
Juan with the Federal Capital; thus providing another
outlet for its grapes, wines and other produce.</p>

<p>An instance of the former commercial apathy of San
Juan, and of its neighbour Mendoza for that matter, was,
not long ago, to be found in the manner in which the growers
of table-grapes allowed themselves to be continually and
methodically jockeyed by the fruit ring of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>The worthies composing this ring were low-class, ignorant
men, who could only grasp the possibilities of monopoly
and market rigging on a very small scale. Their simple
method was to put only a certain limited quantity of fruit
each week on the retail markets of the Federal Capital and
to charge exorbitant prices therefor. To the poor, three-quarter
Indian, ignorant people of the islands of the Paraná
they said that Buenos Aires did not care much for peaches,
and so they only went there once a week or so to fetch a
few, at miserable prices, for market. The rest of huge
crops were left to rot on the trees. San Juan (and Mendoza)
were evidently given to understand that a similar situation
existed in regard to grapes.</p>

<p>How this could have been so is hard to understand,
except on the ground of extreme apathy on the part of the
Provinces concerned, for lots of vineyard owners live at
least half the year in Buenos Aires, and could have told of
the scarcity and high price of fruit in that city.</p>

<p>However this may have been, the fact remained that so
many kilos of table-grapes, and no more, went down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Buenos Aires in specially constructed trucks placed on the
B.A.P. trains three days per week. Until the General
Manager, Mr. J. A. Goudge, decided to act in the better
interests of the Provinces concerned and, incidentally, also
in those of his company, by running grape trains six days
a week.</p>

<p>He thought, perhaps, that the Buenos Aires fruit merchants
would call at his offices with illuminated testimonials.
If he did so he was entirely mistaken. They did call, but
it was to curse not bless. He would ruin them all, they said;
they had comfortably arranged for such and such supplies
of grapes, but more would upset their plans and businesses
completely! They left Mr. Goudge unconvinced. So much
so, indeed, that considering the menace of the ring to boycott
his new trains, he hit on the simple but adequate
expedient of running three grape trains per week from San
Juan, non-stopping at Mendoza, and three starting from the
latter place. San Juan needed its three trains, so did Mendoza,
and therefore no one could boycott either service.
Result, the arrival at Buenos Aires of six grape trains
per week. The ring soon accommodated itself to the
extra supply and went on robbing the busy, light-hearted
Porteños (as people born in Buenos Aires are called) till the
continued efforts of a paternally wise Municipality at last,
after a long and bitter struggle, crushed the power of all the
food rings in that formerly ring-ridden city.</p>

<p>This little piece of economic history is here intended to
show the depths of somnolence and blindness to their own
interests in which the grape growers of San Juan and Mendoza
reposed till, so to speak, only the other day.</p>

<p>San Juan is capable of producing good quality cotton
and tobacco. Its general climate is warm, hot in summer,
and in parts very dry; though the humidity of the soil
and atmosphere of the chief vine areas are greater than in
those of Mendoza. Hence the relative general superiority
and freedom from insect pests of the Mendoza vineyards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>The city of San Juan is Colonial in almost all its aspects,
and its public and private gardens, filled with mingled
tropical and temperate zone trees, shrubs and flowers,
exhale the lazy atmosphere of days the memory of which
is so constantly recurrent in all distant Argentine towns.
Sleepy hollow; maybe, but its charm! A charm which will
not nor can ever be “reconstructed,” try all those of us who
are afflicted with unhappy artistic temperaments, never so
hard. But that charm is still in San Juan, in Misiones (the
one-time “Jesuit Empire”), Salta and Jujuy; in spite of
new Government and Municipal Buildings, electric light
and trams.</p>

<p>Later, we will go to the Falls of Iguazú, greater and more
magnificent than Niagara or the Victoria Falls. These
wonderful Falls are in the great up-to-date, go-ahead
Argentine Republic. What proportion of our “Man-in-the-street”
has ever heard of them? And how many good
intelligent inhabitants of Buenos Aires have any clear idea
of what they are really like?</p>

<h3>NATIONAL TERRITORIES</h3>

<h3>THE PAMPA CENTRAL</h3>

<p>The name of the Pampa is also redolent of romance; of
memories of vast herds of wild cattle and horses, picturesque
gauchos and raiding Indians; but the <span class="smcap">Pampa Central</span> of
to-day is a great and ever-growing cereal area, soon, no
doubt, to become in its own right the fifteenth Province
of the Republic. A Province probably destined to outstrip
rapidly many of its older compeers in the race for wealth
and very modern in its utilitarian progressiveness.</p>

<p>Its superficial area is approximately equal to that of
Mendoza, and though as yet it lacks population, that will
come to it sooner than to many other parts of the Republic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
since it already grows much more than double as much
wheat as all the rest of the Republic put together, after
exception made of the Provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fé
and Córdoba, and more than double as much linseed after
exception made of the Provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fé,
Córdoba and Entre Rios. It also produces more maize than
any Province or other Territory with the exception of the
last-mentioned four.</p>

<p>Its development has been the most rapid of any part of
quick-moving Argentina. No just comparison of progress
can be made with Uruguay; the conditions under which
the latter country has until so recently struggled having
been adverse to rapidity of material development, whereas
the Pampa Central was freed from its only, though great,
disturbing element, nomadic hordes of native Indians, as
long ago as 1884.</p>

<p>This Territory is bounded on the North by the Provinces
of Mendoza, San Luis and Córdoba, on the West by Mendoza
and the National Territory of Neuquen, on the South by
the National Territory of Rio Negro, and on the East by
the Province of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Some parts of the Pampa Central are hilly and wooded
and, as in some parts of the Province of Buenos Aires, ever-moving
sand-hills vary the monotony of other portions of
its surface, but the greater part of it is the continuation of
a vast plain, begun in the Province of Buenos Aires, the
<span class="smcap">Pampa</span> of the Indians, from which it takes its name. It is,
in fact, the Central Pampa; the Eastern being in the
Province of Buenos Aires and the Southern extending into
Patagonia.</p>

<p>Though the Pampa Central boasts only two great rivers,
the Rio Colorado and the Rio Negro, the latter of which
forms its southern boundary, it has many both fresh-water
and saline lakes, and water is seldom to seek far from its
surface.</p>

<p>The chief products of the Pampa Central are wheat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
linseed, maize and oats, but with the growth of its alfalfa
fields and the planting of good grasses in lieu of the native
hard pasturage, it has also become a great centre of the Live
Stock fattening industry, especially during the winter months.</p>

<p>The sandy, salty soil of much of this territory, with water
near the surface, provides, as has been said of similar tracts
elsewhere, just the conditions most favourable to lucerne;
while in other parts the soil is extremely rich in humus.</p>

<p>Three of the great railway systems serve the Pampa
Central; viz. the Buenos Aires Western, the Buenos Aires
Pacific, and the Buenos Aires Great Southern, carrying its
produce to the ports of both Buenos Aires and Bahia Blanca.</p>

<p>Santa Rosa de Toay is the Capital of this Territory; a
purely commercial town which by its rapidly grown importance
supplanted the old Capital, General Acha.</p>

<p>The Pampa Central has also numerous other active
centres of the cereal trade and general commerce.</p>

<p>On the question of its becoming a Province of the Republic
there is considerable local difference of opinion; a good
many of its business men holding that honour dear at the
price of having to maintain a Provincial Congress and various
Ministries and the rest of the appanages of autonomy. In
this they are right. Direct National Government is certainly
the cheapest and it is also very far from being the
worst.</p>

<p>The Pampa Central now exports large quantities of high-class
wool and hides. It also has some copper mines, the
present output of which, however, is not of great importance.</p>

<p>This territory would already, no doubt, have been much
more populous than it is had it not been the scene of one
of the most glaring of the labour-exploiting scandals referred
to elsewhere in these pages.</p>

<p>Here the cases were sufficiently numerous and contemporaneous
to render a menace of serious disturbance possible
to and partially effective by people who had been cajoled
into developing virgin land only to be threatened with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
expulsion (as soon as that work had been done and before
they had been able to derive any profit from it) by owners
who only revealed their existence at what seemed to them
the propitious moment for their appearance on the scene
of other people’s labours. Compromises were arrived at
by which the farmers consented to pay rent for their holdings,
but the scandal undoubtedly kept many others away
from the Territory, and even now an evil result of it continues
in the shape of almost every tenant being obviously
only anxious to get the most he can out of the land while
it is his to work. Few tenant farmers in the Pampa spend
much money in buildings or other improvements.</p>

<p>The Pampa Central is a crying case for the adoption and
insistence by the National Government on the real practical
working out of a true colonization policy. A policy by
which the small farmer could obtain the indisputable freehold
of land which he develops and on which he lives, be he
Argentine or foreigner.</p>

<p>In all else the foreigner actually enjoys under the Constitution
the same privileges (except eligibility for high Government
office, etc.) as a born Argentine. But land! It must go
hard with an Argentine ere he part with his ultimate rights
in that. Yet, I repeat, he must make up his mind to do so
on a large scale or he will find his whole progress arrested
as surely as if the Antarctic zone had suddenly extended its
icy influence over half of his Republic. If he will not give
them land the class of colonist he most needs—the real
<em>settler</em>—will continue to give the country a wide berth and
its output must remain stationary at the point at which it
fully occupies all available labour.</p>

<h3>NEUQUEN</h3>

<p>This is one of the least generally known parts of Argentina.
Misiones figures in the history of the Spanish Conquest
and that of the Jesuit Missionaries,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> from which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
takes its present name; the Territory of the Rio Negro has
of late years become prominent by reason of great schemes
of irrigation (these, however, also affect the Eastern portions
of Neuquen); Chubut came into notice in connection with
the not over-successful establishment of a Welsh colony;
the Chaco is vaguely associated in the general mind with
Indian Reservations and occasional real or reported disturbances
caused by the aborigines confined therein; but
the Territories of Santa Cruz, Formosa, Los Andes and
Neuquen are still little more than geographical expressions
to even the vast majority of the inhabitants of the rest of
the Republic.</p>

<p>A principal cause of this is that most of the inhabitants
of Neuquen are to be found on the Western and most
distant side of it (in which the most fertile, and almost the
only really fertile parts of it, until irrigation is an accomplished
fact, are situated) and because they not only do all their
trading with Chile, but, to all intents and purposes, are
Chileans.</p>

<p>It is quicker and easier to get backward and forward
through well-known Andine passes between Neuquen and
Chile than to accomplish the journey between the rail-head
at Senillosa, a little to the West of the township of
Neuquen, and the productive and well-watered Andine
valleys. The Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway, which
serves this Territory, now, however, has under construction
an extension of the Neuquen line to far up the Andes;
from whence it is intended to connect with the Chilean
Railway system.</p>

<p>Therefore the richest parts of Neuquen are as yet practically
Chilean colonies; from which cattle and agricultural
produce find their way, some paying and much contriving
to escape payment of duty to the neighbouring Republic,
which in return sends such manufactured articles as the
colonist’s somewhat humble needs demand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus10">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">VIEWS ON LAKE NAHUEL HUAPÍ, ARGENTINE NATIONAL TERRITORY OF NEUQUEN</p>
</div>

<p>This Territory is bounded on the North by the Province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of Mendoza, on the West by Chile, on the South by the
Territory of the Rio Negro, and on the East by the Territory
of the Pampa Central.</p>

<p>Neuquen, though Argentina at large knows little of it,
grows more wheat than any other National Territory, except
the Pampa Central, and more alfalfa than any except the
last named and the Territory of the Rio Negro. It also
sends small quantities of potatoes and other table vegetables
to Chile. Its chief exports to that country consist of cattle
and sheep on the hoof.</p>

<p>The whole of the Andine side of Neuquen is extremely
picturesque, and abounds in fertile valleys well watered by
mountain streams. These streams, after their arrival at
the foot of the Andine range, form a network of ultimate
tributaries of the great rivers Colorado and Negro; after
having formed a whole system of lakes of which Nahuel
Huapí is the largest. The scenery of this lake, with the
great snow-covered volcanic mountain <span class="smcap">Tronador</span> (the
Thunderer) on its Southern end, is Scandinavian in its tree-clad
magnificence. The superficial area of this lake is some
1000 square miles and its depth in some parts is over 700 feet.</p>

<p>On one of its islands, Victoria, the enormously wealthy
Argentine family of Anchorena have founded a colony to
work its wealth of virgin timber, on a 99 years’ lease from
the National Government.</p>

<p>A number of small steam and sailing boats ply on this
lake, gathering the wood, hides and other produce of the
farms on its borders and bringing to the farmers their
necessary supplies.</p>

<p>Neuquen is credited with alluvial goldfields and has some
copper. Its mineral wealth is as yet, however, really unascertained;
the prospecting and tentative exploitation of
it having been up to the present only done by syndicates
or small companies whose resources have been too limited
for the tasks they have set themselves in, from the point
of view of transport, such inaccessible regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The Western and South-Western parts of this Territory
are rich in timber, and its Eastern plains should, with
irrigation, repeat the prosperous history of the Pampa
Central.</p>

<p>It has many hot and other mineral springs, the medicinal
and other virtues of which are already known in Chile;
from which country they attract many sufferers from
rheumatism and stomachic and other ailments.</p>

<p>In dealing with all the yet little known outlying parts of
the vast Argentine Republic one is apt to become wearisomely
tautological in one’s endeavours to give some true
idea of their enormous latent natural wealth. Yet if one
set out, ever so modestly, to bring some conception of
them home to the Northern Hemisphere, one must tell the
truth even at the risk of reiteration. And the truth is that
for the future wealth of all these regions there is only one
word, <span class="smcap">Incalculable</span>.</p>

<p>The Territories of Neuquen and the Rio Negro will soon
have irrigation on a vast scale and of most modern design.
This work is being carried out for the National Government
by the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway Company
and is already far advanced.</p>

<p>The virgin soil of the plains of these Territories is almost
incredibly rich in humus and alluvial deposit; and they have
a wealthy Railway Company ready to afford all necessary
means of transport to deep-water ports which nature has
already provided on the Atlantic Ocean at, comparatively,
no great distance from any of, and in many instances close
to, what will be their chief centres of agricultural production
(in the widest sense of that term).</p>

<h3>RIO NEGRO</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;" id="illus11">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="525" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HEAD PORTION OF THE RIO NEGRO (ARGENTINA) GREAT IRRIGATION AND CURRENT
CONTROL WORKS</p>
</div>

<p>The most important of the general observations applicable
to this Territory have already been made immediately
above; remains in their connection only to be said that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Northern side of the valley of the Rio Negro itself contains
some of the naturally richest soil to be found anywhere in
the Republic. Anyone armed with a watering-pot can grow
any temperate-zone crop, fruit or plant and be astounded
by the brobdingnagian proportions of its yield, accomplished
in a space of time suggestive of Jack’s Beanstalk.</p>

<p>And this anywhere in the midst of what now is an arid
desert, on which the only vegetation is sparse, stunted,
scrubby, useless bush.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are that these eastern regions of the
South have practically no rainfall at all and that all the water
running from the Andes to the Sea has already found its
way, farther west, into one or other of the great Rivers
Colorado and Negro.</p>

<p>The huge irrigation scheme now being carried out will
utilize an enormous natural hollow formerly known as the
<span class="smcap">Cuenca Vidal</span>, now rechristened Lago Pellegrini (after a
once prominent Argentine statesman) as a natural storage
reservoir. The surplus water from the lake and river system,
which makes a network over the whole of the western part
of the territories of Neuquen and the Rio Negro, at the base
of the Andes, will be utilized for the irrigation of their
eastern plains. This system is also destined to serve another
necessary purpose: namely, to regulate the flow of the Rio
Negro.</p>

<p>This is very necessary indeed; for this river, swollen by
the melting of Andine snow and ice, which has in some
years taken place in an exceptional degree, comes down
suddenly with overpowering violence, headed by what is like
a huge tidal wave, and sweeps everything within miles of
its normal, deep-cut, banks before it.</p>

<p>Several times during the past fifty years have settlers
been tempted by the rich alluvial soil, brought down by
centuries of just such floodings, to establish themselves
near enough to the actual river to irrigate by some one or
other rough lift system, and remained there year in year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
out, in the false security enjoyed by peasants on the slopes
of a volcano, till one day a thunderous roar has been the
only warning of the immediate approach of a torrential
flood. Lucky the man who could catch and mount his
horse in time to gallop away and thus save his life. All
the rest, cattle, house and crops, were swept away in a
second by the great head wave and following floods of the
river suddenly swollen by the simultaneous overflowing of
its innumerable tributary lakes.</p>

<p>Now all this will be guarded against, and, incidentally,
the Rio Negro may be rendered really navigable for a very
considerable distance by other engineering works for the
removal and control of its bar.</p>

<p>However, and when, this last may be, there can be no
doubt about the magic change that the first partial irrigation
of these present desert plains will quickly create. Trees will
soon grow on the irrigated portions, and these trees and
other vegetation will arrest the clouds which now fly on
unheedingly to the superior attractions of the Andes or the
southern hills of the Province of Buenos Aires. The very
southernmost portion of that Province is now in the same
sad case as the rest of the valley of the Rio Negro, of which
it forms a part.</p>

<p>As the result, smiling verdure will replace arid desert;
in a short space of time, because of the natural fertility
of the soil on which the transformation will take place.</p>

<p>Already two dotted lines on the railway map, one between
Bahia Blanca and Carmen de Patagones, near the mouth
of the Rio Negro, and the other branching from it to San
Blas, show where the Buenos Aires Pacific Railway intends
to run its first two lines through the southernmost strip of
the Province of Buenos Aires which lies between the Rios
Colorado and Negro, and other two dotted lines, one running
southwards from the township of Rio Colorado to the bay
of San Antonio, in the San Matias Gulf, and the other from
the centre of the first to a junction, near Choele Choel, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the main line to Neuquen, show the first intentions of the
Buenos Aires Great Southern line towards that portion of
the valley of the Rio Negro which falls within its agreed
sphere of influence.</p>

<p>In agreeing to a division between them of the productive
and prospectively productive areas of the southern parts of
the Republic, these two great Railway Companies not only
removed from their own paths the disastrous temptation
to cut each other’s throats by tariff war, but also to a
considerable extent precluded profitable competition by
outside enterprise.</p>

<p>The National Government has now a line running from
the port of San Antonio running East and West right across
the Territory. The construction of this line will soon reach
Lake Nahuel Huapí.</p>

<p>San Blas deserves special mention as the probable future
chief port of the Rio Negro valley. On a long inlet of the
Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of which is a large projecting
island and having deep water right up to its shores, San Blas
has been described by high British authority to be the finest
natural port, after Rio de Janeiro, on the Atlantic coast,
both for commercial and strategic purposes.</p>

<p>It formed part of a concession made many years ago by
the National Government to the late Mr. E. T. Mulhall,
the Editor and, with his brother, Mr. Michael Mulhall, the
eminent statistician of his time, joint founder of <cite>The Buenos
Aires Standard</cite>, in recognition of services done for the
development of the Republic; which in those days of its
obscurity and distress was much aided towards a better and
truer knowledge of its possibilities in Europe by the efforts
of what now is the oldest established newspaper in America.
<cite>The Standard</cite> is printed, as it always has been, in the English
language.</p>

<p>The Rio Negro Territory already grows a good deal of
wheat and oats and has the largest area under alfalfa of any
National Territory except the Pampa Central; it also has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
some vineyards and many European fruit trees grow in the
fertile valleys at the foot of the Andes.</p>

<p>The minerals of this Territory are as yet an almost
unknown quantity, except some copper and salt. Petroleum
has also been found at Bariloche, but its commercial
value is not fully ascertained.</p>

<p>The climate of the Rio Negro is temperate and, as has
been indicated, for the most part very dry. One disadvantage
to agriculture in the flat parts of these southern Territories
is the furious winds which frequently sweep over them.
The force of these will, it is reasonably hoped, be broken
by trees in the days to come.</p>

<p>This reminds one of the tragi-comic history of the
contemplated exploitation of certain great salt marshes
situate not very distant from San Blas.</p>

<p>The brine from these was to be, and indeed on a great
inaugural occasion was, run through pipes into immense
shallow basins, where it was to lie until its moisture had
been evaporated by the sun and wind. Afterwards the
salt was to be shipped at the port of San Blas to Buenos
Aires or elsewhere.</p>

<p>All seemed very well with this plan. The brine was duly
accumulated in the drying basins, the sun shone fiercely
on it—and, then, the wind blew and blew. So hard that it
emptied the basins and distributed the brine they had
contained over the rest of the Universe. Thus was a good
scheme brought to naught by the miscalculations of its
initiators. These, however, were wealthy enough to take
the matter in good part. Indeed, it was from one of them
that the present writer had the story. Still there is plenty
of good salt in the Territory.</p>

<p>The Rio Negro has as yet only townships of rough-and-ready
architecture, the centres of its nascent commerce.
Viedma, its capital, is in a fertile tract of land at the mouth
of the Rio Negro; it was, however, almost completely
destroyed by a great flood in 1899. Its communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
with the Federal Capital is maintained by the steamers
which call at Carmen de Patagones, on the opposite bank
of the river, and by ferry thereto and coach to the head of
the above-mentioned new line of the Buenos Aires Pacific
Railway which already reaches half-way between it and
Bahia Blanca. The completion of this line will greatly
affect Viedma for the better, while the regulation of the
current of the Rio Negro will protect it from repeated
destruction by flood. This Territory has a fair stock of
sheep, but few cattle.</p>

<h3>CHUBUT</h3>

<p>Chubut has struck oil, literally. Petroleum was discovered
there only a few years ago (1907), and since the first
discovery many more wells have been sunk in greater or
less proximity to the first find in the district of Comodoro
Rivadavia, situate almost on the southern boundary of this
Territory and on the Gulf of San Jorge. On this gulf of
the Atlantic Ocean, the new oil-fields enjoy an admirable
commercial situation. Remains only to prove fully their
commercial value; of which the great Argentine Railway
Companies are evidently not yet fully persuaded as far as
fuel for their purposes is concerned, since they still use
imported coal.</p>

<p>A long continuance of this present European war might,
however, give stimulus to experiment with Chubut petroleum,
which evidently has some value, even if it need more
preparation for use than the North American and European
kinds.</p>

<p>These oil-fields were, as has often been the case in such
matters, discovered by accident, but the discovery was
made by the National Hydrological Department in the course
of a search for an available water supply for the then new
Comodoro Rivadavia port.</p>

<p>On these fields claims have been allotted to Companies
and private individuals and a certain area has been reserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to itself by the National Government. Most brilliant
results of tests of all kinds are announced, the Government
line of railroad from the Rio Negro port of San Antonio to
Lake Nahuel Huapí “uses no other” (fuel); and yet, and
yet, Comodoro Rivadavia petroleum is slow to make history
in the markets of the world.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Still, time must be given for proof, especially in Chubut,
the general appearance of which Territory suggests that it
was the last word of creation, in one sense, after, of course,
utterly desolate Tierra del Fuego. It is only about two
decades since the Argentine authorities themselves seem
to have grasped the idea that such a place did exist in their
dominions. It is only so long ago, anyhow, that the National
Government thought fit to send the first resident Government
officials to Chubut to look after whatever might need
to be looked after there. Before that, a small part of it
was under the absolute control of a Colony of Welsh people
who first settled there in 1856-66. The rest of it was, and
to a great degree still is, almost exclusively inhabited by
native Patagonians.</p>

<p>The capital of the Territory, Rawson, was founded by
the Welsh colonists at the place of their first landing on the
South Atlantic coast. It has twice been destroyed by the
flooding of the Chubut River, at the mouth of which it
stood; but it has now been rebuilt more solidly than before
and on a site rather more out of harm’s way.</p>

<p>The original Welsh colonists seem to have been a strangely
puritanical and narrow-minded set of persons to find themselves
in such an out-of-the-way corner of the earth as
Chubut then was. So, however, it may be observed, were
certain other persons who landed in North America a much
longer while ago from a ship called the <i>Mayflower</i>. Anyhow,
the Welsh built and their descendants still maintain Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
churches and a stern religious spirit in their town of
Rawson, a somewhat bigoted spirit, be it added, since it
forbade the inter-marriage of its flock with anyone not of
their own, or at any rate British, nationality; nor would it,
until very recently, permit their acceptance of the most
tempting offer to sell any part of the land within the colonised
areas to a “foreigner,” Argentine or otherwise. And this
last restriction does not seem to have been so much due to
foresight of a future increase in land value as to a simple
objection to the admission of any stranger within the fold.</p>

<p>Time will change this no doubt, and change it as soon as
Chubut begins really to advance, but all that time has as
yet done for the Welsh colony appears to have been to sap
the energy of its forefathers; the men who in the face of
discouragement and deaf official ears turned to their just
grievances, struggled on, themselves constructing irrigation
canals, and changed disaster into comparative prosperity.
The Chubut “Welshman” of to-day seems as lazy as his
forebears were energetic. A fresh strain of blood is possibly
needed for his case.</p>

<p>The superficial area of Chubut is very large. After the
Territory of Santa Cruz (to which would seem to have been
allotted all that was left over of the Republic except the
Argentine half of Tierra del Fuego, after the Government
of the more populated parts had been arranged for) it is the
largest National Territory of Argentina, and much larger
than any Province except that of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Its estimated population averages scarcely more than
one per ten square miles, so that there is plenty of elbow
room in Chubut. With a superficial area approximately
equal to that of Italy, the total estimated number of its
inhabitants is but 31,000.</p>

<p>However, no doubt there are good times coming for
Chubut as elsewhere in Argentina, though, petroleum and its
general effects apart, there is relatively little in Chubut to
hasten their coming, except its fertile Andine valleys.
Sheep certainly thrive on its rough, scanty vegetation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
seem to find just sufficient shelter on its wind-swept plains;
but Chubut has little rainfall and its available fresh waters
are few and far between at any practicable distance beneath
the surface. It has only one great river, the Chubut, from
which it takes its name, and this runs very shallow in the
summer, while many of the lakes dry up altogether. In the
West, the Andine region, however, there is ample rainfall,
and this is as yet the only really productive part.</p>

<p>Chubut grows and exports some alfalfa and sends some
cattle to Chile, but its chief product is wool. Its wheat,
however, though still small in quantity, fetches very good
prices. A railway is projected to run East and West across
this Territory. It already reaches from Puerto Madryn to
Gainam, on the River Chubut, a little west of Rawson.</p>

<h3>SANTA CRUZ</h3>

<p>This Territory is bounded on the North by Chubut, on
the West and South by Chile, and on the East by the
Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>Santa Cruz is not by any means so desolate, on the whole,
as Chubut. It is the land of the sheep, and its large, very
large, estancias, either on the Andine side of it or on the
banks of its rivers, mostly belong to British settlers, who
have brought their own architecture, orchards and gardens
with them to this really out-of-the-way spot. Anyone
weary of the crowded world and its busy ways might live
and die under the shadow of the ever-lessening, as one gets
south, heights of the Andine range, in some snug, sheltered
valley through which a rippling stream runs close to where
he would sit on a green sward in the shade of his own
orchard.</p>

<p>This is no fancy picture. As has been indicated elsewhere
in these pages, nothing is so English, temperature, vegetation,
the very breeds of sheep (Romeny March largely predominating),
in America than some favoured spots in Santa
Cruz. Only the climate is different in being drier, the rain
mostly falling in blustering showers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>There is, of course, a contrast when one emerges from
among the Andine valleys, rivers and lakes out on to the dry,
wind-swept, desert-looking plains. Still, even there one
comes at times to oases, on the banks of one or other of the
several considerable rivers. Shelter from the furious winds
which seem to blow eternally over Patagonia is the one
necessity for man, beast and crops in Santa Cruz. Transport
also is lacking. Even the railway which the National
Government has partly constructed to run from Puerto
Deseado, and for the rest has under advanced consideration,
is apparently to strike almost immediately Northwards up
into Chubut; leaving Santa Cruz, as it is now; almost a
world of itself apart, as far at least as communication with
the rest of Argentina is concerned. Its most fertile parts,
like those of all these western and southern territories, are
much more get-at-able from Chile than from their Atlantic
sides.</p>

<p>However, a cold-storage establishment has been built at
Gallegos, the chief port and the capital of this Territory;
so that Santa Cruz may become a centre of the frozen and
chilled mutton industry instead of, as formerly, exporting
only wool and slaughtering sheep merely for their fat and
skins. It is a good sheep country in the regions at all suitable
for grazing, since disease is extremely rare in, if not
entirely absent from, flocks reared in its cold dry climate.
In respect of cattle and cereals the outlook is not so promising.
Still, one cannot have everything even in Argentina.
And one can grow wheat, oats and alfalfa, besides apples
and pears in Santa Cruz.</p>

<h3>TIERRA DEL FUEGO</h3>

<p>First of all it may be said that there are no active volcanoes
in Tierra del Fuego nor have been within the memory of
man. Mr. Paul Walle, in his excellent work, already
mentioned, <i lang="fr">L’Argentine telle qu’elle est</i>, suggests that its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
name may have been given it by early explorers who
observed burning on it grass fires lit by the natives for the
purpose of improving the growth of certain shrubs the
leaves of which they use for food.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the name “Fire Land,” as my friend
the Government official translator naively has it in the
English edition of the Monographs attached to the latest
Argentine agricultural census, is anything but a warm spot;
as certain demagogues who long troubled the industrial
peace of Buenos Aires have shown that they are well aware.</p>

<p>These people were at one time periodically deported for
inciting to commit or committing overt violence in connection
with labour strikes. They were mostly anarchists
of the type which tyrannical Governments all the world over
persist in regarding as criminal. These men were put on
board boats bound for their native countries, the police of
which were telegraphically advised of their departure and
intended destination. Needless to say, the anarchists took
good care to contrive to leave the boat before she reached
what was for them a danger zone. Usually they got out at
Montevideo and soon were back again at their old work of
stirring up strife in Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>At last the National Government had enough of this procedure
and Congress passed a law whereby any person having
been sentenced to deportation is, on being subsequently
found in the Republic, liable to a term of penal servitude;
and the fact that Tierra del Fuego would be the penal
settlement to which recalcitrant anarchists would be sent
was duly and insistently made public. This had a very
beneficial effect for the Government and peaceable citizens
at large. Dangerous anarchists thenceforth ceased to return
to Argentina after deportation. They knew, or at least had
read or heard, what the climate of Tierra del Fuego is; and
that for people like them, used to fairly comfortable living,
confinement there most likely meant burial there also.</p>

<p>Not quite half of this charming island, over which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
winds blow straight from the South Pole, belongs to Argentina
and forms the National Territory under discussion.
The other half of it belongs to Chile. Geologically most of
this island is a prolongation of the Andes. On the Atlantic
side of its forest-clad hills are sloping plains, the continuation
of the Pampean formation. On these a peculiarly hardy
breed of sheep graze, finding some shelter in valleys and
hollows, and give a wool which fetches a good price in
European markets. Grazing of a rough kind does also maintain
cattle and horses on the Northern parts of the island.
Fish and shell-fish of a multitude of kinds and good quality
abound on the coast and afford material for a profitable
industry, as also do the seal and whale fisheries, and penguins
are hunted for their oil. All these fisheries are supposed to
be under Government supervision, regulated by special
laws; but, in fact, the practical difficulties of adequate
supervision result in an enormous amount of highly destructive
poaching.</p>

<p>The official estimate of the total cultivated area of
Argentine Tierra del Fuego is 110 hectares, of which 90 are
stated to be planted with potatoes and other table vegetables.
The number of sheep is given by the same authority (Señor
Emilio Lahitte, Director of the Department of Rural
Economy and Statistics in the National Ministry of Agriculture)
as over 2,500,000 and cattle at about 15,000.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Silesian Brothers have a mission,
schools and an estancia on the island; and a Protestant
clergyman, the late Mr. Bridges, during his lifetime did a
great deal towards civilizing and bettering the condition of
the native Indians and also kept a self-supporting refuge
home for the victims of the shipwrecks of small craft which
are still too numerous on this wild storm-beaten coast.
This good work is now being carried on by his son, the first
child of European parentage born in Tierra del Fuego.</p>

<p>Ushuaia, the Capital, is chiefly notable for the penal gaol
above alluded to. Formerly convicts were kept, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
often for long before death overtook them, on an island which
forms the very southernmost point of South America. It is
a terribly cold, damp region where rain falls on an average
280 days in the year. On consideration, perhaps it is the
reputation of this place which has so effectually damped the
ardour of deported anarchists; as the Ushuaia gaol is a
modern structure, said to be furnished with all the latest
requirements for the well-being of prisoners. Still, even it,
in Tierra del Fuego, can provide but uncomfortably cold
lodging.</p>

<p>Tierra del Fuego is not lonely for it has many fishing ports
and all navigation must pass it on the way through the
Magellan Straits. For all that, one cannot but wonder why
any but prisoners and prison and other officials go there
(except, of course, fishermen and the adventurous spirits
who are ever hunting in every accessible nook and cranny
of it for alluvial gold) when there are so many much
pleasanter and more profitable places, with, between them,
all varieties of climates to choose from in the wide latitudes
of the River Plate Republics. <i lang="la">De gustibus</i>, etc., one must
suppose—and yield obedience to the final words of the
saying.</p>

<h3>MISIONES</h3>

<p>If one has sufficient Spanish, one should read Leopoldo
Lugones’ <cite>Imperio Jesuitico</cite>, and also the same author’s
<cite>Guerras Gauchas</cite>, before going to Misiones. If not, one
should go there all the same.</p>

<p>This territory is bounded on the North-East and South
by Brazil, and on the West by Paraguay and the Province
of Corrientes. It is sandwiched in between the rivers Paraná
and Uruguay, but a very much smaller Paraná and Uruguay
than we have seen further south.</p>

<p>Many parts of Argentina have been described as “The
Garden of the Republic,” and many as its most picturesque
region, but the latter description can surely only truthfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
apply to Misiones. If not sufficiently trim and cultivated to
be called a garden, its superlative beauty and its crowning
marvel the Iguazú Falls must leave even the most callous
visitor pleasurably astounded; and not a little awestruck
with its ruins and reminiscences of the dawn of South
American civilization, which was heralded in these parts
by the Jesuit Fathers. These Missionaries made most
practical Christians of the surrounding tribes; teaching
them the arts of architecture, carpentry, and such-like;
not forgetting humility and obedience.</p>

<p>If one wants proof of all this one need but look on the ruins
of monastery and church now half hidden amid an ever-encroaching
luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p>The descendants of those same Indians can hardly be got
to do as much work in a lifetime now as they must have done
in a week under the mild but very firm rule of the Jesuit
Fathers. Eventually, the power these Missionaries had
attained over the surrounding tribes became such as to label
them dangerous to even Catholic Spain; and an order was
given, and enforced, for their expulsion. They were scattered:
and but the ruins of their solid, sculptured masonry, gardens
and orange and olive groves now mark the places where once
white-clad natives kept fast and feast days with as much
solemn orderliness as ever so many timid monastic novices
could do.</p>

<p>Nowadays, one can get from Buenos Aires to Misiones
either by rail (North-East Argentine Railway) or by the
Mihanovich company’s boats. Both ways furnish delightful
travelling through interesting and picturesque country,
though for pure scenery the river way is the best. The best
of all, however, is to go up by rail and down again by boat
and to see all there is, and there is a very great deal worth
seeing, to be seen.</p>

<p>By either route one can stop at Posadas, the capital,
evidently from its name an ancient resting-place for
travellers (Posada being Spanish for an inn).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>But people who are bent on reaching San Ignacio, a small
river port, or rather clearance on the Upper Paraná, near
which are the chief of the ruined Jesuit Missions, and the
Iguazú Falls will probably leave Posadas for closer inspection
if need be, on the return journey.</p>

<p>Once again we board a Mihanovich boat and go up a
seeming river of fairyland.</p>

<p>An adequate description of the majestic splendour and
beauty of the Iguazú Falls is far beyond the pen of the
present writer. One is gradually prepared for the great
sight by a series of smaller cascades and cataracts of other
converging rivers which one passes on the way to where the
Iguazú hurls its large volume of water in downward jumps
or in one horseshoe-shaped, thundering, frothy mass. Where
it falls one is face to face with the greatest waterfalls in the
whole world,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> as the following comparative figures will show:</p>

<p class="noindent">The only point of advantage of the Victoria Falls is their
height.</p>

<p>The present chief source of wealth in Misiones is the
various kinds of timber and valuable cabinet-maker’s woods
found in its virgin forests. One day Misiones will doubtless
export its rosewood and other beautiful and valuable
products of its forests, which also produce pine and other
building timber of superior quality to that which Argentina
now imports from Europe. Transport of timber is effected
by means of tying it into huge rafts which go down river as
far as Corrientes. The timber supply of Misiones will long
continue rich, since the tendency of the forest is ever to
encroach on the surrounding land.</p>

<p>A growing industry on which great expectations are based
is the cultivation of the Ilex Paraguayensis, or mate shrub.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
The consumption of mate or Paraguayan tea, as it is sometimes
called in Europe, is enormous throughout both of the
River Plate Republics, which now import very large quantities
annually from Paraguay and Brazil, while no sort of
good reason seems to exist why the northern districts of
Argentina should not grow sufficient to meet the home
consumption.</p>

<p>The Jesuits evidently appreciated and cultivated this
shrub, but they had the secret of growing it from seed, a
secret the true re-discovery of which by modern horticulturists
is not yet quite proved.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Up till quite recently all Misiones mate yerba has been
gathered from the abundant virgin growth of the shrub.
Once Misiones produced larger quantities of sugar than it
does now; and there is no reason why this industry should
not revive from the almost total paralysis which it at
present suffers; nor why one day the wine output of
Misiones should not be improved in both quality and
quantity.</p>

<p>Maize naturally grows well (it yields in six months) in
Misiones; which Territory with the general warmth of its
climate, sufficient rainfall and heavy dews, is most favourable
to tropical and subtropical vegetation. Oranges, of course,
bananas, pineapples, and guavas grow practically, if not
quite, wild and ground nuts and the castor-oil plant are
among its many valuable products. The whole of Misiones
is well watered by a network of very numerous streams, and
if its atmosphere by day is rather reminiscent of a hothouse,
the nights are usually cool and refreshing.</p>

<p>The unevenness of its surface, while precluding much idea
of extensive cultivation, is admirably suited for the shelter
and care of the best natural produce of this exotically
picturesque region.</p>

<p>Misiones has quarries of valuable granite at San Ignacio;
close to the river as if they had been placed there for facility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of transport. These quarries furnished the Jesuits with the
material for their famous buildings; though that they persuaded
the natives, who before their coming had little
ambition for anything save inter-tribal warfare, to quarry,
transport and build up solid masonry is nothing short of
marvellous. Truly Jesuit “influence” was a very real and
concrete thing in the Misiones of those days.</p>

<p>One must not forget tobacco, or cotton, as other of
Misiones’ hitherto greatly neglected industries.</p>

<p>One cannot insist too much upon the fact that no one who
does not himself visit the River Plate Republics in all their
length and breadth can really grasp even a faint idea of their
diversified latent wealth. One is apt to suppose that because
Misiones, for instance, does not produce much tobacco or
sugar,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> there is some pretty solid obstacle at the bottom of
its relative non-productiveness. People naturally think,
“Well, it’s all very well to chant dithyrambics of the
marvellous might be’s of what evidently are your pet
countries, but why does all this wonderful wealth of them
continue latent, why does not one see, or at least hear, a
great deal more about it, if all you say is true?”</p>

<p>The reply for this is, “Give me sufficient capital and
sufficient suitable labour (especially the latter) and I will
very speedily prove my every word.”</p>

<p>The River Plate Republics have not yet (again I say it)
sufficient population to exploit even a part of their possible
cereal industry, the one which naturally gets first attention
because it combines the attractions of rich profit and comparatively
little care or labour, under the almost primitive
conditions under which most of it is still carried on.</p>

<p>When there is a surplus of labour after grain and cattle
have been duly provided for, all sorts of other things will be
attended to. But it is no good expecting ordinary people,
without the many more or less occult advantages of early
Jesuit Fathers, to get any constantly careful work, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
cotton, tobacco and many other valuable crops require, out
of native South American Indians. They can’t or won’t do
it, anyway, they don’t; and it is probably easier to rediscover
how to grow mate yerba from seed than how to rediscipline
for practical purposes the race which built and
gardened in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>The North Argentine Railway has in project a branch from
its Santo Tomé-Posadas line to run through the centre of
Misiones to the North-West corner where the frontiers of
Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay join.</p>

<h3>FORMOSA</h3>

<p>This, the northernmost of the Argentine National
Territories, does not merit the superlative of its name;
especially it does not do so when compared with Misiones.
Geographically and in its general superficial characteristics
Formosa is a continuation of the Chaco, by which it is
bounded on the South. On the North and East it is bounded
by Paraguay except at its South-Eastern corner, where its
boundary is the river Paraguay, with the Province of Corrientes
on the other bank. On the West it is bounded by the
Province of Salta.</p>

<p>Much of Formosa is almost unknown land as far as really
scientific exploration is concerned; and some tribes of its
<span class="smcap">Toba</span> Indians still appear to have an inconveniently violent
dislike of official explorers, several having been murdered
by natives in recent times.</p>

<p>The real exploration of the interior of Formosa is done by
squatters who, when turned off one holding, move on to a
new one further from the civilisation which, such as it is, is
mostly to be found on the River Paraguay, or near to it on
the banks of its chief affluents, the Pilcolmayo (which forms
the Northern boundary between this territory and Paraguay)
and the Bermejo. The clearance of the rocks, sunken logs and
masses of vegetation from the beds of these rivers as a preliminary
to the carrying out of other works for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of making them navigable is under consideration by the
National Government, which also proposes to build a railway
line from Embarcación, in the Province of Salta, across the
centre, almost, of Formosa, in a South-Easterly direction, to
its capital, a town of the same name and, doubtless, the first
to bear it. At present Formosa has no railroad at all.</p>

<p>This Territory has several other considerable rivers and
streams all running nearly parallel to one another and to
the Pilcolmayo and Bermejo, in South-Easterly direction, to
the River Paraguay.</p>

<p>Almost the whole of its surface is a vast plain gently
inclined; its South-Eastern part is largely covered with
forests and dotted with many shallow swamp-like lakes—“Esteros,”
as they are called.</p>

<p>The forests are very rich in various valuable woods; of
which the chief object of present commerce is the <span class="smcap">Quebracho</span>,
which here, as elsewhere in the Republic, is found in two
varieties, the red and the white. The former is the richest
in tannin. Quebracho extract (for tanning purposes) will be
seen to figure prominently in the tables relating to Argentine
exports.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Quebracho logs are in constant demand for railway
sleepers.</p>

<p>The wide glades and open spaces in the forest afford
excellent pasturage, and are all eminently suitable for agriculture.
Some parts of this territory are destined to become
rich alfalfa fields, and already relatively considerable areas
are under this forage. There is plenty of salt, sandy soil with
water near the surface. Maize also, on account of climatic
conditions and the nature of the soil in parts (where a rich
layer of humus is superimposed on a moist, sandy subsoil),
should form a valuable crop in this Territory.</p>

<p>Formosa, with its Northern situation and therefore almost
tropical climate, has few sheep; but cattle, still of the native
breed, thrive well in many parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Also, in Formosa, and in Misiones, a large proportion of
traction bullocks must be reckoned among the numerical
value of their cattle.</p>

<p>In Formosa the summer or rainy season lasts for about
seven months of the year; little or no rain falls in the winter
or dry season—as in the tropics. In the wet season many of
the rivers overflow their banks and such, likely, inundations
should be taken into account by any would-be purchaser of
land in Formosa.</p>

<p>He should also keep his eyes open for dangers other than
floods; for if scientific exploration cannot yet be said to
have obtained any firm grasp of Formosa, how much less
can measurements and boundaries be hoped to be in order.
They are not so in most of this Territory, and a purchasing
settler might eventually find himself with little for his
trouble and money but the costs of a lawsuit forced upon
him by some owner of an historic grant made by a grateful
Republic in bygone days to the grandfather of such owner
for distinguished service of one kind or another.</p>

<p><i lang="es">Latifundíos</i>, these low-lying Argentine landowners are
called; and it is not too much to say, as has been indicated
elsewhere in these pages, that their existence is a pest and a
menace to proper colonisation.</p>

<p>Every such absentee landlord should be forced by law to
declare himself and his claims, and to furnish measurements
and situation of the land, the subject of the latter to be
checked by the Government surveyors and lawyers; and
to do this within a fixed reasonable period from the date of
the passing of such laws. His claim to lapse absolutely
<i lang="la">ipso facto</i> in default of his doing so.</p>

<p>Then the National Government should proceed to allot
fiscal lands to all desirable comers, and afford these the
aids to starting their farms and plantations usual in other
countries having unoccupied land awaiting development, as
still is by far the greater part of the territory of the Argentine
Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Every educated Argentine is just as well aware of all this
as the writer or you, the reader; but just think what a
flutter in aristocratic dovecotes on the mere suggestion of
the putting in practice of such Laws (they or drafts of them
probably exist in the pigeon-holes of Government House in
Buenos Aires)! What a fluttering in those dovecotes there
was a few years ago when the discovery was made, and most
imprudently revealed, that vast tracts of land supposed to
belong to the Nation had in fact got, in one way or another,
into the possession of private individuals.</p>

<p>The then President, Dr. Figueroa Alcorta, declared
vehemently (and caused the declaration to be published far
and wide) that whomsoever were found to be responsible for
such a scandalous state of things would be dealt with without
mercy, whoever he or they might be.</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>The sentence was like those of the Queen of Hearts in
<cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite>. No one really ever was executed.
Nor, as far as the public ever knew, even called to account.
Possibly someone was told not to do it again; it must be
hoped so.</p>

<p>In Formosa, latent absentee landlord and squatter would
almost appear to work on a mutually beneficial, if tacit,
understanding. The former does not in the least mind
his land being developed by the latter (there is no foolish
worry about such things as prescriptive rights) and generally
lets him be; until such time as he, the landlord, wants to
occupy himself or sell.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the squatter has accumulated cattle and
money by selling stock (contraband, if possible, or covered
by a few duty-paying animals) in Paraguay, and need only
move on a few leagues or so, when told to, with his herds.
His house and furniture are usually negligible quantities.</p>

<p>Formosa does as much trade as the total of its general
products (except timber, which goes South) allows of,
because Paraguay is generally too much overrun by revolutionary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
or momentarily constitutional, forces to have
much time or space free for industrial occupations. At the
same time Paraguay does manage to produce large quantities
of tobacco and mate yerba which Argentina takes, although,
as has already been observed, her own lands could perfectly
well produce them, given suitable labour.</p>

<p>As has been rather more than hinted at, the official
Returns of Imports and Exports as between Bolivia, Paraguay
and Brazil and Argentina give but a faint idea of the
actual trade between the last-named and her northern
neighbours; and the present writer would be much surprised
to learn that the upper reaches of the River Uruguay
could tell no tales of systematic smuggling between the two
River Plate Republics, or the Andes none of similar practices
between Argentina and Chile.</p>

<p>The fact is that adequate guard of these enormous and
sparsely populated lengths of upcountry frontier would
cost more than the results of it would pay for. And why
make a fuss while such prime necessities of life as mate and
cigarettes are comparatively so cheap?</p>

<p>Formosa produces tobacco and sugar; the latter, as
in Misiones, being chiefly used for the production of
alcohol.</p>

<p>A great deal of foreign capital is now invested in timber
cutting and exporting companies. Native labour is suitable
for this work, but it is desirable in the interests of the companies
concerned that the native overseers or gangers be
controlled by whites conversant with native ways and also
having the gift of forest topography.</p>

<p>This last consideration is suggested by the undoubted fact
that many a pile of logs has been solemnly measured up
and the felling paid for several times over by the white
gentleman who has failed—in consequence of a slight rearrangement
of the pile, no doubt—to recognise them on
successive visits to glades and clearings which all look very
much alike except to particularly experienced eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus does the untutored Indian or half-caste sometimes
laugh at civilization.</p>

<p>Formosa, although sparsely inhabited, boasts a large proportion
of pure whites of various nationalities among its
settlers and the timber companies’ employees. There are
several Franciscan Mission Stations in the Territory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This hasty run over the Argentine Republic has stirred
many pleasant memories in the heart of the writer, and set
him hoping that, perchance, some one reader may be
tempted to take passage to the River Plate; at less cost
than, and quite as luxuriously as, if he made his usual
sojourn on the Mediterranean Riviera.</p>

<p>Would I could take him—an intelligently enthusiastic
person he, of course, would be—on a personally conducted
tour of my own designing.</p>

<p>We would go first to Buenos Aires, reserving the restful
charm of Montevideo for after our journeyings. Then
down South; where I should quite disabuse my gentle
companion of any ideas he might have that the owners of
square miles of wheat and thousands of cattle live in top
boots and shirt sleeves in one-storied, corrugated-iron
verandahed houses in the foreground of threshing machines.
I would get him invited—and myself as well—to stay a day
or two at an English estancia; the large, well-appointed
two or three storied red-brick house of which, surrounded by
lawns and spreading cedar trees, would make him rub his eyes
several times before he were convinced that he had sailed
out of England. He would surely find a house party from
Buenos Aires or neighbouring—a wide term meaning,
probably, many leagues away—estancias in possession; all
the members of which would retain their old habits of dressing
for dinner and breakfasting off a choice of several hot dishes
and a tempting array of cold things on the sideboard. An
English country house, in fact, with hall and magazines and
illustrated papers complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we should make plans for the following, and, probably,
many other morrows; plans which would almost
inevitably include a neighbourly race meeting or polo
match.</p>

<p>Amid all this he could dree his own weird for as long as
might please him. I should not disturb any of his promised
projects.</p>

<p>But one day I should take him North again; and still
further North, to Córdoba, “The Learned City,” show him
the Cathedral, the University and its Library, and let him
breathe the monastically mediæval atmosphere of it all.
And, outside the city, the wildness of cactus growth and
gaucho life.</p>

<p>Back eastward to Rosario, merely to change train for
Santa Fé, and across the Uruguay to Paraná. From thence
to Concórdia; where at least one tranquil orange-scented
morning must be spent before one crossed the Province of
Entre Rios to where the Argentine North-East Railway
should take us to Misiones.</p>

<p>After San Ignacio, the Iguazú Falls and the trip thereto
and therefrom up and down the Upper Paraná, I should ask
him if he ever wanted to go anywhere else again? Whether
he has ever even dreamed of anything so beautiful? Then
by river all the way back to Buenos Aires; and, one night,
across to Montevideo. There we would sit awhile in the
evening and listen to the band in the square where the little
coloured lamps swing in the fresh sea breeze; and bathe
next morning and roll ourselves in the hot dry sand of Pocitos
or Ramirez.</p>

<p>Then we would take railway trips in Uruguay. Over
billowy pasturage and through waves of wheat; not flat
expanses such as those we shall have seen on the Pampa, but
seas of corn-covered, undulating ground.</p>

<p>Then he could go back to Europe, if he liked. I should
stay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<h3>URUGUAY</h3>

<p>If a detailed sketch of each of the Departments of Uruguay
be not given here it is not because they are altogether uniform
in their landscapes; but rather because, apart from the hilly
rockiness of some of the northern parts, the scenery of
Uruguay does repeat itself. While the climatic differences
are relatively slight in a country which barely extends over,
from the point of its extreme northern angle to its most
southerly point, five degrees of latitude; in comparison
with those of Argentina, which extends over thirty-five
degrees.</p>

<p>Uruguay, therefore, has no striking variety of climates;
and except that the surface of the Northern Provinces is
more broken with jagged mountain ranges and that in the
neighbourhood of the River Uruguay and its affluents the
country is more thickly wooded, there is not much change to
be noted anywhere from its general character of an undulating
grassy plain, with here and there a mount, or clump of
low wood and brushwood, and an abundance of running
streams.</p>

<p>Its indigenous flora comprises a rich wealth of rosemary,
acacia, myrtle, laurel, mimosa, and the scarlet-flowered
<span class="smcapuc">CEIBO</span>; while its natural pasturage is gay with red and white
verbena and other brilliantly coloured wild flowers. The
best natural grasses are to be found in the Departments of
Soriano and Durazno and in parts of Paysandú and Tacuarembó.
That is to say where what is known as the “<span class="smcap">Pampa
mud</span>” of the soil is mingled with calcareous and siliceous
matter and contains less aluminium, which last ingredient
imparts cold and damp qualities.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus12">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A TYPICAL SMALL “CAMP” TOWN (RIVERA, URUGUAY)</p>
</div>

<p>It should not be assumed from the above short general
description that the scenery of Uruguay is monotonously
uninteresting. It is not; on the contrary, it is often very
beautiful indeed, with sudden and delightfully surprising
changes as the train speeds along. But these changes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
on a small scale, if one may so express oneself, compared with
those which one experiences when passing from one distant
Argentine Province or National Territory to another.</p>

<p>Indeed, as a glance at the map will show, geographically,
Uruguay and the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul can
almost be considered as parts of Argentina; as, politically,
they once very nearly were.</p>

<p>The real great division of the nature of the surface of
Uruguay is practically formed by the course of its Rio Negro;
on each side of which are vast rolling plains, the northern of
which, however, are, as has been said, traversed by ranges of
indented rocky hills.</p>

<p>The whole of Uruguay is subject to abrupt changes of
temperature and frequent strong winds of which the <span class="smcap">Pampero</span>,
from the South-West, is the most violent.</p>

<p>Generally, the climate is pleasantly mild. For while the
summer suns are hot, especially in the North, sea breezes and
winds from the snow-capped Andes modify the temperature.
It is, however, from these conflicting elements of sun and
wind that Uruguay gets her quick changes of temperature
and frequent storms. The whole country is subject to
alternate overflowing of its rivers and drought.</p>

<p>Uruguay is rich in table fruits. Grapes, oranges, lemons,
apples, pears, quinces, melons, passion-flower fruit, peaches,
apricots, cherries, medlars, figs, chestnuts, almonds and, in
the North, olives, dates and bananas, grow in abundance.
The list of her flora also includes sarsaparilla (very abundant),
quinine, camomile and many other valuable medicinal
plants. Uruguayans have also given themselves the trouble
to produce relatively much larger quantities, and, generally
speaking, better qualities of ordinary table vegetables than
have the, perhaps busier, inhabitants of the larger Republic
across the river; to which, however, Uruguay daily sends
large quantities of such produce.</p>

<p>Uruguay has several large flour mills and exports flour,
chiefly to Brazil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the soil consists of one composition or another of
the Pampa mud before alluded to. This mud is really
ancient alluvial deposit.</p>

<p>Of the latent mineral wealth of Uruguay there can be
little doubt. The Department of <span class="smcap">Minas</span>, as its name indicates,
is one of the richest in this respect. Gold, in quartz
formation, silver, copper, iron, lead, some coal, marble of
various kinds, slate, rock crystal, agates, jasper, graphite,
alabaster, black limestone and other minerals of commercial
and industrial value are to be found in this Department and
in other parts of the Republic. Fine building limestone is
found in the Department of Maldonado. The Department
of Colonia is rich in granite and other building stone, as well
as other minerals. Rocha, Soriano, San José, Florida and
Canelones are other Departments rich in mineral wealth.</p>

<p>This wealth has, however, as yet been little exploited.
The old trouble here, as in Argentina, being that of insufficient
labour to attend to more than the primary industries
of Live Stock and Cereal production. Also the Uruguayan
Mining Laws, though steps have recently been taken to
amend them, have hitherto proved but a poor protection
for capital.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><i>Note.</i>—The wealth of the Argentine National Territories of
<span class="smcap">The Chaco</span> and <span class="smcap">Los Andes</span> is, as to the former still practically
confined to the valuable forestal products, full mention of which
has been made elsewhere in these pages. The future of Los
Andes can only be concerned with the exploitation of its, probably
rich, mineral deposits; this Mountainous Territory being
so cold and arid as to be almost uninhabitable.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">AGRICULTURE</span></h2>

<p>The figures representing the progress of Agriculture
in the River Plate Republics, especially in Argentina,
which has had the advantage of freedom
from Civil War during by far the longer period, during the
last few decades are truly astounding.</p>

<p>In 1875 the value of the principal Argentine Agricultural
Exports was but 114,557 gold dollars; in 1913 the value
of these exports was 307,520,854 gold dollars. In 1892 the
total of the cultivated areas of the Republic was only
580,008 hectares; in 1912 there were 22,987,726 hectares
under cultivation, this figure not including the pasturage
improved with foreign grasses. The first ten kilometres of
railway line in the River Plate Territories were laid in
Argentina in 1857, now the extent of lines in that Republic
is over 21,000 miles, and that in Uruguay over 1590 miles,
making a total for both Republics of over 22,500 miles, or
rather less than the total length (23,350 miles) of the lines
in Great Britain. And new lines and extensions are projected
in all directions and will prove profitable.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be taken for granted by the above
juxtaposition that the railroad has been the whole and direct
cause of agricultural extension. That many other causes
have been at work is evident since River Plate agriculture
and export flourished long before the railway was dreamed
of anywhere. During the early years of its life in the River
Plate Republics the railroad was busily enough occupied in
the endeavour to serve districts already under cultivation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and it is only in very recent times that one of the great
English Companies adopted the, even then much criticized,
policy of extensions to secure in advance a sphere of future
cultivation. It may be added that no adverse criticism of
this policy (but only approving admiration) came from
anyone practically capable of forming an opinion of the
agricultural prospects on which it was soundly based.</p>

<p>Still, Argentine railway enterprise in general is conservative
in that it rather waits on than seeks to create a demand
for its services; so that the rule in these matters on the
River Plate continues to be that the railway very cautiously
follows the lead of other progress and enterprise, and much
rich land in the more distant Provinces and National
Territories lies fallow waiting for the railway, while the
railway is waiting till actual production guarantees the
immediate profit of new lines at handsome rates.</p>

<p>Time will solve this sort of deadlock as it does other
things; but to most people, other than railway directors,
its existence seems to indicate a lack of commercial courage
and energy. They manage some of these things, in some
respects, better in the United States.</p>

<p>At the same time it must be owned that the existing
railway policy protects the countries now under discussion
from many of the greater evils of local land booms and
speculation in Town lots; which in early North American
days often left little but disillusionment as the share of
inexperienced speculators and paved the way for equally
disastrous railway competition.</p>

<p>In Argentina and Uruguay, particularly in the former
Republic, the great Railway Companies form something
really very like the <i lang="la">Imperium in Imperio</i> that the Argentines
say they do. Their General Managers are quite as much
diplomatic Ministers Plenipotentiary as they are actual
Managers of railroads; and, consequently, require qualifications
of which the chiefs of even our greatest British
systems have no need. The work of a General Manager of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
a great River Plate railway system lies a good deal at
Government House and with the leading men and politicians
of the country. He must know how best to protect the
vested interests of his Company and to pave the way for
new developments in competition with newly arrived applicants
and existing competitors. For such purposes he must
combine firmness, serenity in protest if need be, with
urbanity and the power to be all pleasant things to all men
whose good-will is or may possibly be of use to his Company.
The slight diversion of a projected new line is a small price
to pay for the easy passage through Congress of the scheme
of a whole important extension. A scheme which may
menace the aspirations of an existing competitor or an
expectant rival concessionnaire; either of whom may also
command some “influence.”</p>

<p>All this, however, however true, is a digression from the
question under immediate discussion, namely, to what
extent the railway has been a cause or an effect of the spread
of agriculture in the River Plate. The real answer to this
question appears to be that both the railway in these
countries and the agriculture have inter-aided and are inter-dependent
on one another in the inevitable development of a
prosperity fore-ordained by a prodigality of natural endowment.</p>

<p>Comparing the figures representing the cultivable area
of these Republics with those relating to the parts already
under cultivation, one can see why extensive farming is
only just now giving way to intensive systems in those
districts the situation of which, in relatively close proximity
to the great port of Buenos Aires, combined with the natural
fertility of their soil, has rendered them the most valuable
of all the lands in the Argentine and Uruguayan Republics.
The capital valuation of these lands is now so high, especially
in the Province of Buenos Aires, that all means must be
adopted which will enhance their annual productivity. In
other parts it is often cheaper to put more land under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
cultivation than to lay out capital in improved working of
that already in hand. As facilities for transport and the
population grow, so will the need for intensive farming, in
gradually increasing complexity, be more and more felt
and complied with throughout both Republics.</p>

<p>Contemporaneous with such advance will be the gradual
development of those products, other than wheat, linseed,
maize and alfalfa (to which the whole available agricultural
energies of these countries have till now been almost exclusively
confined), for which the natural conditions of one part
or another of the two Republics are eminently favourable—such
as Cotton, Tobacco, Timber, Rice, Sugar and, perhaps,
Coffee.</p>

<p>To quote a pamphlet recently issued by the Argentine
Government:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There are vast tracts of land available for the cultivation
of sugar cane. … With the investment of large amounts of
money and an increase in the area cultivated this industry will
no doubt in a few years be able to supply fully the demand and
have a surplus of 50 per cent over for exportation.</p>

</div>

<p>This statement, notwithstanding the rather quaint
English of the official translator, has already nearly been
proved true, and might have become so in actual practice
several years ago. To quote again from the same pamphlet
and with a similar endorsement of its statements:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In the extensive regions existing in Salta, Jujuy, the Chaco,
Formosa, Misiones, Corrientes and Tucumán (the last-named
with 300,000 hectares admirably adapted for sowing sugar cane)
the area cultivated will gradually increase.</p>

</div>

<p>It should and certainly will do so at some future time.
When, depends chiefly, as do many, if not most, other agricultural
developments on the River Plate, on increase of
population.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Argentine National Ministry of
Agriculture has done much good work towards stimulating
interest in the undoubtedly great possibilities of cotton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
tobacco and rice cultivation. The cultivation of cotton is
no new idea on the River Plate. It could hardly be so when
there are large districts so evidently and admirably adapted
for this crop. The reasons why several former well-meant
attempts at cotton growing in Argentina were unsuccessful
were the difficulties of obtaining and keeping adequate
labour, and a too great reliance on the bounty of nature
unaided by much human science. Selection and just appreciation
of the time for gathering were matters which did
not receive sufficient attention, and a great obstacle certainly
was the difficulty of obtaining labour in sparsely
populated districts, in which the necessities of life are procurable
by all with a minimum of effort. The natives
fancied they were being exploited if they did not get commercially
impossible rates of wages for what appeared to
them extremely arduous and unwontedly continuous and
careful work. Work of the satisfactory execution of which,
moreover, their primitive mentality was not really capable.</p>

<p>Even now River Plate cotton growing will need to be
largely aided by imported or colonist labour. Given that
and due scientific management and care, applied in the first
place to the selection of the seed most suitable to the soil
and climate, there is no sort of reason why River Plate
cotton should not occupy a highly remunerative place in
the world’s markets, where cotton is always in increasingly
large demand.</p>

<p>Many districts in the Argentine Provinces of Corrientes,
Santa Fé, Salta, Tucumán, Catamarca and La Rioja and
in the National Territories of Misiones, Formosa and the
Chaco are eminently suited for cotton cultivation.</p>

<p>It will be observed that Argentina alone is almost always
here referred to in connection with these secondary (as they
still are) products of the River Plate countries. The reason
for this is that, while many parts of Uruguay are equally
well suited for their growth, the latter Republic is, owing to
her later continuance of civil disturbance, in a less advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
condition than Argentina in regard to extensive development
of the great primary industries of cereal cultivation and
stock breeding.</p>

<p>Tentative and apparently successful cultivation of better
classes of tobacco has already been commenced in the
Province of Buenos Aires and official drying sheds have been
erected in each of the Provinces of Tucumán, Salta and
Corrientes and the National Territory of Misiones. These
facilities should greatly stimulate the increase of production
and improvement of quality of the leaf in those, the most
climatically appropriate, districts. Even if they should not
confer on the growers the “moral and intellectual” benefits
explicitly expected from them by the aforementioned
translator.</p>

<p>As for rice, even if the question of export be reserved
for future consideration, there is an enormous local demand
which could very well and profitably be supplied locally.</p>

<p>Experimental cultivation of this crop in large and suitably
watered areas of the Provinces of Buenos Aires, Entre Rios
and Córdoba has proved the ease with which it could be
grown in them.</p>

<p>Another crop in universal demand in both Argentina and
Uruguay is <span class="smcapuc">MATE</span>, or “Paraguayan Tea,” the leaf of the
<span class="smcap">Ilex Paraguayensis</span>. This shrub grows wild in the
Territory of Misiones and in the Republics of Paraguay and
Brazil; and Argentina and Uruguay import it from the
latter countries to annual values of several millions of gold
dollars. The cultivation of mate yerba only presents
difficulty and risk of loss during the very earliest periods
of its growth; but study has now shown how to avoid most,
at any rate, of such risks, so that it has become an absurdity
that such an article of universal daily, indeed hourly, consumption
in both of the countries under consideration
should not be grown by them in districts so suited for the
cultivation of this shrub that they have become its home
in a perfectly wild condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherever one goes in Argentina and Uruguay the <span class="smcapuc">MATE</span>
(as the small gourd in which the infusion of the dust-like
<span class="smcapuc">YERBA</span>—“herb”—is made, and from which it is sucked
up through a special tube called the “bombilla” from its
perforated, bulb-shaped end) is omnipresent and usually
in working evidence in the hands of one or other member of
the household throughout the livelong day.</p>

<p>Mate is a stimulant of great sustaining and stomachic
qualities; and its use is not followed by the depression
which follows excessive tea and coffee drinking. A River
Plate <i lang="es">peon</i> will go from daybreak to midday, riding or doing
physically hard work the whole while, on nothing more than
a hunch of bread or a “biscuit” (a hard, dry maize-flour
roll) and a few small <i lang="es">mates</i>. With sugar, mate is very palatable
and the taste soon develops into a habit, but in the camp it
is usually drunk “bitter,” that is, without sugar, both
from motives of economy and because it is popularly supposed
to be healthier and more sustaining when taken in
that way.</p>

<p>At any rate, there can be no doubt that mate growing
must one day become a very large and profitable industry
in the Northern parts, where the climate is suitably mild,
of the two Republics.</p>

<p>The Jesuit Fathers, from whom the Territory of Misiones
derives its name, were well aware of the wholesome qualities
of mate yerba, and it is possible that the now wild growth
of the shrub in that Territory owes its existence to their
cultivation.</p>

<p>In connection with their primarily great agricultural
industries, the wheat, maize and linseed crops which will
always remain a chief pillar of their prosperity (even if
stock-raising on the present huge scale should be reduced
by the encroachment of agricultural or, as is most likely,
mixed farming; or if the Andine regions prove as rich in
minerals as some people would have us believe), the River
Plate Republics must always occupy positions of ever-increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
weight and importance on the cereal markets of
the world.</p>

<p>The world wants meat, but it must have bread, the true
staff of human life. Signs are not wanting of the coming of
a day when the majority of the human race will be forced
into vegetarianism by the growing scarcity of meat; but
the time when wheat shall be no longer obtainable by the
multitude is so much farther off on the speculative horizon
as to be a negligible factor in any but abstract contemplation.
As for live stock, most middle-aged people to-day can retrace
in their own memories the decline of the meat exports
of the United States; where a rapid growth of population
and spread of agriculture have so increased the local consumption
and diminished the supply that the States not
only now eat all their own meat, but already import from
Argentina and Uruguay.</p>

<p>When the latter countries arrive at a similar stage of their
development, as they must do one day, from whence will
they and the rest of the world get meat supplies? Even the
greatest and most terrible war the world has ever known has
not reduced the population of the globe to an extent which
will do more than very temporarily, if practically at all,
affect the question of its future food supplies.</p>

<p>Recently the reproductive capacities of the existing
Argentine and Uruguayan flocks and herds were brought
almost to a standstill in respect of the increase of their
numerical value; chiefly on account of the ever-increasing
demands and high prices paid by the Cold Storage Export
Companies.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> And purely economic reasons cause more and
more land each year to be put under cereal cultivation while
numerically large flocks and herds are pushed further into
less accessible regions of the Republics, on the boundaries
of which vast quantities of finely bred animals already graze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>More transport (and labour), more cereals; more cereals,
less live stock: will be the rule of these Countries’ progress,
following that of the great Northern Republic. A rule
which mixed and intensive farming will only modify in a
degree quite incommensurate with the experiences of an ever
and rapidly increasing demand.</p>

<p>The future of both Argentina and (later on) Uruguay
appears to be bound up in their cereal production (of which
wheat, maize, linseed and oats are now the chief elements).</p>

<p>I say <em>appears</em>, because the Andes may yet yield marvellous
mineral treasure; good coal may yet be discovered; it and
the petroleum deposits of Comodoro Rivadavia and elsewhere
may yet provide fuel for manufacturing industry;
and the River Plate Republics may yet become the great
pig-producing countries of the world, as a United States
expert once prophesied to the present writer that one day
they would be. But all these things, even if the future do
hold them in store, are beyond the perceptibly practical
horizon; while the already preponderating influence of
cereal production on the destinies of Argentina is immediately
evident. Argentina practically supplies the world
with linseed.</p>

<p>Uruguay is still in the infancy of its agriculture. It has as
yet but some two million acres of cultivated land as against
some thirty million acres of pasturage. But the world’s
demands will doubtless lead it on the same course as that
imposed on the United States and Argentina; modified,
perhaps, to some extent by the more undulating nature of its
lands as compared with the flat Pampa. Again, Uruguay is
much richer in running streams than is Argentina; which
latter country is but sparsely provided with water courses,
especially in dry weather.</p>

<p>During the course of the last decade the value of the
cereals exported from the River Plate tripled.</p>

<p>The great areas of cereal cultivation are the Provinces of
Buenos Aires, Santa Fé, Córdoba and Entre Rios and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
National Territory of the Pampa Central. Cereal growing
in Uruguay is still chiefly confined to the Southern Departments
of that country.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Uruguayan wheat has received special
quotations as the highest quality of any in the European
markets; and “Montevideo wheat,” as it is called, is much
purchased by Argentine exporters to mix with their own
grain. The cultivation of alfalfa (lucerne) is also increasing
with enormous rapidity, both for home consumption and
export; and is likely to show still greater proportionate
increase as mixed and intensive farming grow in favour.</p>

<p>Economic necessity may also soon increase the cultivation
of this valuable plant as an alternate crop on, and restorative
for, the exhausted soil of many districts where wheat has
been grown on wheat since, one might almost say, time
immemorial.</p>

<p>Wheat, as all the agricultural world knows, absorbs the
nitrogen from the soil on which it is grown; while alfalfa, on
the other hand, absorbs nitrogen from the air and deposits it
in the soil. These two crops are therefore, as was found out
long ago in North America, naturally complementary. And a
course of alfalfa prepares ground for the replanting of wheat
in a way unequalled by the most expensive artificial fertilizers.
The time will therefore doubtless come when
Argentine farmers will plough up such of their alfalfa as may
be on suitable ground and plant wheat thereon; and,
contrariwise, will plough up their wheat and give the ground
two or three years of alfalfa before putting wheat on it
again.</p>

<p>But this is still, to the vast majority of Argentine farmers,
an absurdly impracticable counsel of perfection. Since, does
one think, he asks, that he is going to spoil his alfalfa fields,
soon after seeing them pass through the critical stage of their
tap-roots reaching water, and break his ploughs into the
bargain by cutting those thick, tough roots up again?
Not he. Alfalfa it is now and alfalfa it is going to remain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to yield him four or even more cuttings annually. Only
time and ever-growing land values will force this kind of
reasoning out of his mind. He, in the more distant parts of
the country at all events, is still in the stage of mentality
when what were good enough methods for his forefathers are
good enough for him. Nature has been kind to him. He has
always reaped much benefit from little labour or capital
outlay; and this state of things suits his nature so well that
he is altogether disinclined to vary it by following theories
which do not appeal to him, be they preached never so wisely
by the ambulant Agricultural Instructors employed by the
Government to travel about the country and teach improved
methods to its rural inhabitants. The deaf ear which even
the very well-to-do among what may be called the peasant
proprietors, the little-educated rural classes, that is to say,
turn to the teachings of modern science is due to the fact
that these people have long been too much spoilt by nature’s
gifts of highly fertile soil and favourable climate to perceive
any very pressing need to bestir themselves to unaccustomed
expenditure of energy or money.</p>

<p>Thus, as is told elsewhere in these pages, thousands
of head of cattle and sheep die each time a drought occurs
simply because their owners will not go to the trouble and
expense of boring for water (seldom far from the surface)
and putting up windmills to draw it.</p>

<p>Education and economic pressure will in due course end
this era of <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i>; which is doomed to disappear
from even the most outlying of rural districts as surely as
the traditional <span class="smcap">Mañana</span> has from the business communities
of the great cities. Nowadays, a denizen of Buenos Aires
who scents a good stroke of business will pursue and capture
it with a rapidity and real vigour which would not shame
a citizen of the United States. Only, the Argentine will
always conceal his haste under an affected outburst of
boisterous humour or an equally assumed dilatoriness of
manner. He will, in fact, be politer about it than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Northerner. But he will get there all the same. So will the
agriculturist, comparatively untutored as he still often is,
once he realizes his own advantage in the matter; as
circumstances eventually will force him to do.</p>

<p>Just now the River Plate countries are faced with an
exceptionally acute phase of the problem of their increased
agricultural expansion; the governing factor of that
problem, indeed the whole cause of it, being their lack of
adequate rural population.</p>

<p>To appreciate this inadequacy one must realize that the
Argentine Republic alone is only a very little smaller than
Germany, Austro-Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, France,
Holland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Portugal and Switzerland
put together; while her population is only some 7,500,000.
Of this over a million is in the city of Buenos Aires; and
the other cities such as Rosario, Bahia Blanca and the
Provincial capitals account for another.</p>

<p>Even were the whole 7,500,000 equally spread over the
Republic, we should only get an average of 6·5 per square
mile, as against some 193 per square mile as the average of
the other countries named above for comparison of area.
Uruguay has a considerably larger population (and, it may
be added, railway mileage), to the square mile than Argentina;
but even then it has only some 1,200,000 inhabitants,
or about half the number possessed by the Province of
Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Unless this state of things be remedied, it would appear as
if the hitherto rapid advance of both agriculture and stock-breeding
in these countries must soon reach a point beyond
which they can no further go for want of hands to sow, reap
and carry crops and rear and tend cattle and sheep! This
situation is not a perfectly new one in modern economic
history; but it may safely be called new in degree when it is
found in countries where all other natural conditions are
normally so entirely favourable to uninterrupted rural production.
In countries not (as yet at all events) directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
involved in Armageddon; and while so much of the rest
of the world urgently needs every grain of wheat and every
ounce of meat they can possibly send out.</p>

<p>Great irrigation works now in progress will open up
further vast and almost unprecedentedly fertile areas for
cultivation; which areas railway lines are practically ready
and waiting to serve with transport and for which new ports
are in course of construction while existing ones are being
enlarged and improved. New agricultural laws have been
passed to meet difficulties which have arisen with already
increased production and land values; everything in fact
has been done and is being done to second and enhance
nature’s gifts.</p>

<p>But the question, “Where are the human beings necessary
to an advantageous result of and to benefit by all these
preparations?” still remains unanswered; except by the
apparently very stubborn fact that they have not yet
appeared on the River Plate and show no signs of doing so.</p>

<p>At the present moment the outlook from this state of
things reveals only a tangled problem, in view of the awful
wastage of human life now going on in Europe. But for its
occurrence and continuance before the war the Governments
of Argentina and Uruguay are almost wholly to blame, and
that of the former country in much the greater degree. This
because, while Uruguay may be said to have only just
emerged from a long period of internal political disturbance
which necessarily absorbed all the time and energies of her
statesmen, Argentine politics long ago reached their destined
haven of sunlit, calm waters.</p>

<p>Argentina <em>has</em> spent much trouble and money in propaganda;
in all sorts of publications giving true and therefore
favourable statistics of her ever-increasing rural industries,
trade and prosperity. But—and this cannot be insisted on
too often for her own good and for Uruguay’s example—she
has never even seemed to trouble herself about suitable
people who might be attracted by the perusal of her statistics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and pamphlets to wish to know more of her and of their
exact individual prospects did they decide to set sail for her
shores.</p>

<p>Like so many of the good laws and schemes in which
this country abounds, everything concerning prospective
colonists is excellently arranged and set down on paper;
but nothing is yet in really practical working order for the
reception and assignment of land to the real colonist, the
man most needed in new countries, bringing with him a
small capital which he wishes to invest in a holding which
will be the future home of himself and his family.</p>

<p>It seems a hard saying, but I hold it truth that the only
provision yet made has been, and is, for the reception and
despatch upcountry of the very poorest class of immigrants;
glad to get a job at manual labour of any kind, and therefore
at the mercy of the landowners who still really govern this
pretendedly ultra-democratic Republic.</p>

<p>It is—whether accidentally or of set purpose is needless to
discuss here—in point of fact through the influence of landed
proprietors, and through their influence alone, that the
elaboration and putting into practice of existing colonization
schemes and laws lie fallow; while poor immigrants, by
a seemingly cynical courtesy, called “Colonists,” are granted
the privilege of a share in any immediate profits to be
derived from breaking up virgin soil from which they will be
turned off practically as soon as it begins to yield—to
commence a similar operation elsewhere if they care to—under
conditions which leave them little choice.</p>

<p>Congress and the National Provincial Governments are
to blame for this, really suicidal, scandal; resulting from a
condition of things so patent that the Italian labourers who
come for the harvest return back home again to an existence
of probably considerable hardship in Italy, in preference to
remaining as “Colonists” under the blue and white banner
of Liberty.</p>

<p>The root of all this is that the Argentine <em>cannot</em> bring himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to part with the ownership in land, and the fact of his
having done so in the past still rankles bitterly in his mind;
forgetful of the fact that then that was the only way to
interest foreign capital in the development of his country.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that, if he will not and does not give land
to colonists, he will find that his prosperity has reached sticking
point for want of labour to advance it any further.</p>

<p>That is to say, the agricultural production of Argentina
has almost, if not quite, reached the limits of the power of
the Republic’s seven million inhabitants.</p>

<p>“The case for the Colonist” has been put with such
admirable accuracy by Mr. Herbert Gibson, in a recent
pamphlet by him called <cite>The Land we Live on</cite>, that the
present writer has been unable to resist the temptation to
cite some passages from it at length. A temptation enhanced
by Mr. Gibson’s faculty for hitting exactly the right nails
on the head coupled with his command of a vividly virile
style.</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson is a member of a family of very large landowners
in Argentina; a man of exceptionally high moral
and intellectual qualities, and an accepted and respected
authority on all matters concerning Argentine rural industry;
the best interests of which he has done much to
advance, often at his own considerable pecuniary cost.</p>

<p>A born Argentine, he can lay bare to the public eye the
weaknesses and faults of the agricultural systems of the
Republic in a way and to an extent impossible to a foreigner
without a strong likelihood of the latter doing much more
harm than good to the cause of reform by what would
probably be deemed by Argentines a gratuitously offensive
advocacy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It should rather befall the man who cries to the shoeblacks
and hotel waiters of the city, than to us who are of the land, to
plead the cause of the colonist. But let us state his case for him.</p>

<p>An examination of the meteorological conditions, the constitution
of the soil, the economy of inland collection, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
average proximity of the radial point of export to the site of
production has usually convinced the intelligent traveller, very
especially if his intelligence is engaged in ocean or land transport,
that the Argentine is the garden of the world.</p>

<p>A closer examination of the abruptness of the thermographical
curves and their relation to soil foods and the growth and harvest
of its products; the difficulty of collecting from units of large
area, and at the precise moment of their maximum yield and
maturity, the seeds of annuals; the yet unbridged gulf between
the field of production and the main channels of its collection;—might
well lead the intelligent traveller to a contrary conclusion.
When he ceased to generalize he would find the lot of the agriculturist
was not as easy as it looked.</p>

<p>Burmeister no doubt overstated the case if he said that wheat
would never prosper in the Pampa soil. If he said that wheat
cultivation would not prosper in the Pampa except under skilled
husbandry we could find it easy, after twenty years’ experience,
to agree with him.</p>

<p>Meantime the best has been done to make it unsuccessful.
The agriculturist, if we are to call him one, is let loose on a
five hundred acre pitch of the prairie. In so many cases that one
is entitled to generalize, he set out on borrowed land with
borrowed implements to scratch the soil for three, four or five
years and sow wheat on it.</p>

<p>If he is asked whether he sows winter or spring wheat he does
not know. If he is asked how many tons of straw he harvests,
he neither knows nor cares. If he is asked what calcium carbonate
and nitrate are, he thinks they are sheep dips, but is not quite
sure. If he is questioned on rotation, he waves his hand to the
rolling Russian thistle that gathers like a snowdrift against every
obstacle.</p>

<p>His house is, at best, an enlarged sardine tin. He has neither
barn, byre nor pigsty. He has no enclosures for cattle, sheep
or poultry. He has no garden. He has not a single tree to shelter
him from the sun. With land suited for every form of live stock
and field farming he is enslaved to the deadly monotony of wheat
growing.</p>

<p>There may be countries with a soil and climate such that
white straw crops can be grown for a large number of years in
succession without exhausting the land or setting up soil sickness.
We know it is done at experimental farms such as Rothamsted.
But we know too that the efficiency of soil culture in pursuit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
these experiments is beyond the practical ability of the colonist;
nor is the economy of the farm an item that is taken into consideration.
We know, because we have witnessed it, that in
this country after the colonist’s term of four or five years,
during which he has collected an average crop of eight bushels
per acre, is ended, what remains is a five hundred acre field of
weeds.</p>

<p>We can grow weeds. Whatever other merits may be denied
to us we have achieved the production of a garden of weeds
without equal in the world. Some of them are good plants for
animal food, but out of place, for the colonist has not the means
to make use of them for that purpose. Others are weeds of
the most useless and noxious description. If it be true that
the scabby Argentine sheep has been a source of wealth to
European chemical manufacturers, the day must surely come
when still greater fortunes will be made out of weed-spraying
nostrums.</p>

<p>Until this agricultural arab whom we call a colonist is replaced
by an occupant with permanent or sufficiently long fixity of
tenure; until he has adequate barns, byres, sties, water sweet
and cheap, a garden and a homestead; and until he is possessed
of cattle, sheep, swine and poultry he will remain as economically
lean and weak as the muzzled ox. We have talked much of
rural banks to enable him to borrow more money; but we have
not begun to put into practice the rural economy that will be
followed by the rural bank as sure as summer follows spring.
When the agriculturist profits, instead of loses, on the year’s
overturn, he will build up the bank on his own thrift.</p>

<p>Within the economy of soil cultivation there is room for two
alternatives only. Either the landowner must himself farm his
land, or he must lease it with sufficient fixity of tenure and farming
equipment to secure to his tenant the prospect of being able
to pay a fair rent.</p>

<p>Agriculture in this country has very largely failed through
an attempt to drive a middle course between these two alternatives.
The landowner, usually one possessing a large area and
hitherto a pastoralist, has seen, or has thought he saw, a larger
profit to be earned by turning his soil to agriculture. Instead of
putting it to the test by turning agriculturist, he has paid his
intelligence the sorry compliment of believing that an illiterate
Italian, spewed up on our shores may be a year since, could earn
this large profit if he were let loose upon the prairie without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
further capital or assistance than the right to plough the soil,
in exchange for a share of the harvest, to be delivered threshed
and bagged to his landlord.</p>

<p>The benefits the landlord has derived from this, in a great
majority of cases, have been to collect a smaller rent than he
could have earned if he had depastured or farmed the land
himself; and to receive back at the end of three or four years
his pasture land converted into a garden of weeds. The process
is termed “improving the land by the plough.” Not long since
properties in the market were advertised as especially attractive
if they were “all under agriculture.”</p>

<p>Having sowed the wind the landlord is reaping the whirlwind.
He has not only failed to profit by agriculture, but he has pledged
the land and squandered the proceeds. The matter is not that
such silly methods of rack-renting, bonanza farming, land gutting
and money lending have wrought their own confusion. It is
the loss to the industrial community, to the rural population,
and to the national thrift that lays bare the defects of the system.
These are the fruits. We have to look into the ordering of our
agricultural industry, not as determined by a “good year” or
“bad year,” a “dry” or “wet” year, but by such a readjustment
of our rural economy that the soil shall be no longer
cultivated at a loss. It is necessary to unmuzzle the ox. Without
the aid of domestic live stock the colonist can neither profit
from the by-products and fallow of the land, nor can he restore
to the soil the factors necessary to yield crops that are of themselves
profitable.</p>

<p>Neither have we been careful to conserve and stimulate the
settlement of a truly agricultural population on the land. We
have exported the cult of sterility from the old world to the new.
We have measured in this new world a field of production, not
for the labourers, but for their European mandatories. It was
said in the days of the Spanish dominion that America was the
“factoria” of the mother country. She has seemingly not yet
ceased to be regarded as a “factoria.”</p>

<p>We take pride that we export so much and need so little.
We call it a favourable “balance of trade.” We spread abroad
pamphlets and graphic charts and dreary columns of ciphers to
show how successfully we have gutted the land we live on to fill
alien mouths. We display pictures of train loads of labour-saving
machinery, glorying in the fact that one man aided by
Pittsburg steel and Cardiff coal can fend off twenty families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
from a thousand acres, and garner the yield for the contentment
of fat-handed brokers eating lobsters in a distant
city.</p>

<p>Had the matter been understood rightly by the “estanciero”
of a generation or two ago, nay, even by this present generation,
he would have put a premium on fecundity. His business was
to encourage population; but while he drowsed in siesta hour
over the newspaper proclaiming the arrival of alien immigration
and smiling unctuously at the intelligence, he condemned his
own men to celibacy, unwilling to spend the price of five bullocks
on a mud hut to cradle the generation on his own land of a race
of lusty yeomen. He took pride in the number of calves and
lambs born on his estate. It would have beseemed him better
to take pride in the number of <em>babies</em> born there.</p>

<p>Such a consummation would be vastly upsetting to Malthusian
economists who view with jealousy the peopling of new fields
of production. They would have us believe that it is only here
by the overflowing of the Nile, and there by the discovery of the
New World, that the human race has been saved from famine.
If we can no longer send 350,000 tons of meat and five million
tons of cereals to the Old World our usefulness has passed away
and our mission ended.</p>

<p>Fiddlesticks! Had the Pampas of South America, the pasture
lands of Australia, and the wheat fields of Canada remained
virgin there would have been ere now thousands of acres in Great
Britain under glass and harnessing the solar spectrum and the
electric currents of air to manufacture food for the people.
Feminists, instead of rending other people’s garments to bewail
the departure of their mankind, would be conjuring out of four-inch
potsherds fruit rich and rare for the household. If among
the social economists of the present generation there is a disposition
to revert to the Malthusian creed; in this spacious
country, and as far as the vegetative population is concerned,
there is no need to raise the voice of alarm. National progress
and thrift will be soonest achieved by the increase of the national
population; and, without closing the doors to useful alien immigration,
the welfare of the community should be dependent
rather upon the increase of the family than upon the overflow
population from other lands. … Under our present system
of agriculture the domestic requirements of the country are
sacrificed to foreign demand. We measure our progress by our
export trade of raw produce. When we speak of agriculture what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
we really mean is the production of maize, wheat and linseed for
shipment abroad.</p>

<p>It is to this end that so much has been heard of warrants,
elevators and other devices to enable the farmer to dispose of
his crop. They are in some degree devices for his own security;
but they are in a much greater degree devices to secure for the
export of cereals a more regular flow from the sources that supply
it. The time is no doubt distant when this country shall have
a population sufficient to consume the raw produce of its soil;
but by turning our eyes constantly to its export trade as the
sole source of its production we have not only limited the lines
of our agricultural production, but we have neglected complementary
lines that would have increased that export trade by
maintaining soil values.</p>

<p>The cereal that gives the best return from a large area of our
Pampa soil and climate is barley. Being shallow-rooted our
indifferent tilth suffices for its seed bed; and being short lived
it can be sown late and harvested early, reducing the risks from
frost and drought. The “chacarero” who produces 8 fanegas
of wheat could produce on averages from the same soil and with
no better husbandry 18 fanegas of barley per hectare. In food
equivalents that is equal to 280 kilogrammes of pork.</p>

<p>The “chacarero” does not grow barley for the same reason
that he neglects or ignores almost every branch of agriculture
except wheat, maize and linseed. For the same reason that he
neglects rotation, fallow and weeds; vegetables and small
fruits; live-stock breeding and feeding; poultry, dairy, and bee-hiving,
tree planting; and the greatest of all cultures—home
culture. He has no fixity of tenure. There is no other reason.</p>

<p>It is said of the Argentine “chacarero” that he is ignorant
and incapable of good husbandry. When he first began, of
course, he was ignorant. The gold medallist from an Agricultural
College is ignorant when he begins to practise farming. Though
the farmer’s craft engages the whole cyclopædia of science, and
there is no limit to the knowledge it demands, its practice is
essentially one of observation and local experience. To those
the “chacarero” comes as well equipped as another. His
ignorance is but the reflection of his environment.</p>

<p>It is also said of him that he is greedy, and undertakes a larger
area than he can cultivate. Again, his greed is but the reflection
of the landowner’s. He is called to the land on terms that exclude
all fixity of tenure, maintenance of soil values, small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
farming, rotation or live-stock values; terms that merely bind
him to plough as best he can a given area, to seed it in cereals
that will enable his landlord to collect without inconvenience
his rent in kind, delivered “dry, sound and bagged” at the foot
of the threshing mill; to continue this process for three or more
years; and at the end of his term to go to the devil if his unsuccess
has not already landed him in that quarter.</p>

<p>In a scheme of agriculture that was to take no heed of the
permanent thrift of the land and the man who tilled it we have
failed; as we deserved to fail, most miserably. We have built
upon this most uncertain apex as a base, an inverted pyramid
by which ocean and land carriers, merchants, brokers, speculators,
and every branch of parasite commerce were to wax lustily.
We may devise as we will rural credits, schools of agriculture,
prophets of agrarian science, bellowing from the tail-end of peripatetic
railway coaches, grants of seed, warrants, elevators,
labour-saving machinery, and every other panacea to nurse the
sick field labourer. Until we give him fixity of tenure he will
continue to be a sick man. There has been no other solution to
agricultural problems of the past. There can be no other solution.
Our present rural population, concentrated on less than the
present area they are engaged in cultivating, with continuity of
usufruct or compensation for improvements secured to them,
would produce a larger cereal harvest than they now do, and add
to the wealth of our animal produce, and still more to the accumulation
of our national thrift.</p>

</div>

<p>In Uruguay progress is still possible to the existing population;
since the consequences of the civil disturbances which
until recently paralysed the production of this country, by
the constant commandeering of men, horses and supplies by
one or other of the combatant parties, have not yet been
overcome by the existing settlers who, therefore, still have
work ready to their hands. Nevertheless, for Uruguay also
it is a case of the more the merrier; more available labour,
more rapidly increased agricultural output. Once means are
found for an appreciable and constant increase of the population
of these countries, immediate results of such increase
may be expected not only from their production of Cereals,
Live Stock and the “Secondary” products already enumerated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
but also from coffee, chicory, tea, arrowroot, sugar-beet,
sweet sorghum, hops, cinnamon, vanilla and very many
others, for the cultivation of all of which favourable conditions
are to be found in one or other of the various climates
found between the many degrees of latitude traversed by the
length of Argentina and the various altitudes between the
Argentine Andine frontier line and the sea.</p>

<p>At the same time much could be done for their own
comfort and prosperity by farmers, in the ample time which
their chief occupations necessarily leave them, by the cultivation
of some of these secondary products for their and
their neighbours’ use. At present their almost unaccountable
neglect to do so justifies an <i lang="la">obiter dictum</i> of the great Argentine
statistician, Dr. Francisco Latzina, in a Monograph by
him attached to the last Argentine agricultural Census.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” Dr. Latzina says, “that the Ministry
of Agriculture ought to take a decided initiative in encouraging
horticulture which, as we see, does not supply
the National demand. To add to the climax, even eggs are
imported in this year of grace. If this goes on, the day will
come, perhaps, when bread and milk shall be imported in
order to be able to export all the wheat, flour and butter
produced in the country.” (By “horticulture” Dr. Latzina
means, in this connection, the produce of the Kitchen
garden.)</p>

<p>It is a fact that, as he says elsewhere in the same Monograph,
garlic and onions, peas and beans figure among the
imports of a country possessing millions of acres of fertile
land! While the farmer frequently buys his potatoes at the
Store. This neglect on his part of everything which does not
savour of export is one of the factors of dear living in Argentina.
Uruguay is on a somewhat different footing in this
regard, her rural population having, as has already been
indicated, still about as much as it can do in making good
the ravages of past Revolutions.</p>

<p>Still Uruguay sends vegetables to Buenos Aires, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Uruguayan housewives complain of the high prices of
Kitchen stuff which, consequently, now rule in the Montevidean
markets.</p>

<p>A very large proportion indeed of the whole of the Republic
of Uruguay may be considered as cultivable. In
Argentina the question of how much of the whole area of
that country may be so considered is yet without exact
solution.</p>

<p>In this regard therefore it may be well again to quote Dr.
Latzina, who says:—<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is difficult to determine even approximately the cultivable
area of Argentina, because hitherto, and yet for some time to
come, the extent covered by mountains, deserts, salt marshes,
sand-hills, swamps, moors and lagoons, and the Patagonian
table-lands, which are almost entirely uncultivable—not so
much so on account of the poor soil, but on account of the
want of water and the boisterous and continuous winds which
blow incessantly day and night in those parts. A calculation
such as I wish to make can only be roughly made, and I may
say that I doubt if the cultivatable area of Argentina be greater
than half its total area—in round numbers, 150,000,000 hectares.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Latzina then suggests the reservation of two-thirds
of that area for stock-breeding, leaving only 50,000,000
hectares for pure agriculture.</p>

<p>However, hardly one-half of this last-mentioned area is as
yet under cultivation; leaving plenty of room for the
present for the extension of agriculture.</p>

<p>This fact of very large areas within the Territory of the
Argentine Republic being, chiefly for climatic reasons (e.g.
the more southern and the mountainous parts of Patagonia),
unfit for either cultivation or pasturage, except in the latter
regard for goats and perhaps the very roughest kinds of
sheep, should not be lost sight of when comparing Argentina
with Uruguayan statistics. One eminent Uruguayan Agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Authority, for instance, has triumphantly referred
(in, it must be considered, a more patriotic than strictly
scientific spirit) to the fact, as stated by him, that the value
of the Exports of Uruguay, per square mile of that Republic’s
territory, are double those, similarly reckoned, of Argentina.
Even accepting his figures as correct, which Argentine
statisticians do not, the deduction he obviously suggests is
certainly based on fallacious reasoning; indeed, the very
comparison itself is misleading.</p>

<p>Uruguay is a small, compact country not two-thirds the
size of the Province of Buenos Aires, containing practically
no exclusively mountainous or arid or otherwise desert large
areas and none of the obstacles, of distance, or other kinds,
encountered by transport in Argentina.</p>

<p>Truly some statistics suggest that their compilers believe
that “Figures can be made to prove anything.”</p>

<p>In connection with Agriculture, locusts still unfortunately
succeed in not letting themselves be forgotten. From time
to time vast swarms of these rapacious insects appear,
covering and darkening the sky for leagues. They come from
their breeding centres, undoubtedly somewhere in the huge
virgin tracts in the western tropical regions of Brazil. Many
well-meaning persons have counselled measures for their
extermination there. A counsel of perfection, alas! Those
who have preached have never been even on the frontiers of
the thousands of square leagues of tropical forest and undergrowth
which yet have scarcely ever heard the voice of
man. To dream of exterminating locusts there is as if one
proposed to empty a running stream with a bucket. An
impossibility.</p>

<p>All that can be done is to attack and destroy the swarms
when they have arrived. For this purpose special and, it
should at once be said, very successful organization have been
brought into existence by the Argentine National Government
with the loyal concurrence and aid of the Provincial
Governments and by the Uruguayan Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the <span class="smcap">Defensa Agricola</span>, as this organization is
called, encountered a good deal of passive resistance from
rural landowners who, doubting its efficacy and seeing in it
or affecting to see in it, rather a means of affording remunerative
jobs for Government hangers-on, declared that its
officials who pervaded the country requisitioning labour and
supplies were a worse nuisance than the locusts themselves.</p>

<p>The Defensa Agricola continued its work, however, unheeding
of such protests; and now, for some time past, may
be said to have fully justified its existence and its methods
by results in both countries.</p>

<p>It has its centres of observation, like any other force prepared
to repel invasion, and, on the coming of a swarm
being signalled, every human being in its course is called
upon to aid in the defence.</p>

<p>The plan of this defence consists, briefly, in driving and
sweeping the insects into trenches backed with long lines of
sheets of corrugated iron, placed together end to end. Once
gathered into these trenches the locusts are burned; and by
the untiring continuance of this process they are gradually
destroyed before much damage (very small indeed compared
with the ravages of pre-Defensa Agricola days) has been
done.</p>

<p>The sweeping-up process can be usefully employed for the
extermination of settled swarms otherwise its members will
quickly proceed to deposit eggs which later would hatch into
young “hoppers” born with infinitely more voracious
appetites than even their parents had.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Locusts, as has been seen, come from the North and in the
normal course of their nature would disappear again in that
direction, leaving bare fields and their hungry young behind
them in memory of their visit. Still in recent years, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the full development of the Defensa Agricola, it appeared
that locusts had actually become acclimatized in some
regions of both Republics, notably in the Southern part of the
Province of Buenos Aires and in the Territory of the Rio
Negro, and therefore did not return North but managed to
survive frost.</p>

<p>This last menace may now, however, be considered as
past.</p>

<p>The Defensa Agricola does not only devote its attention to
locusts. It possesses a highly trained scientific staff which
combats the invasions of all the other insect pests which from
time to time threaten the crops, vines or fruit and other trees
and useful vegetation. It issues clear instructions as to the
treatment to be applied in each case and punishes noncompliance
with its orders by fines which it is empowered to
inflict.</p>

<p>Agriculture has much for which to thank this Institution
in respect of protection against pests; the danger from which
was increasing with the importation of vines and fruit trees
from other countries.</p>

<p>The Argentine organization is under the direct control of
the Ministry of Agriculture<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>; an indefatigable Government
Department the immensely wide sphere of whose work is
ever increasing; Division being added to Division as need
arises from the ever-increasing number of the branches of
National Industry, whether agricultural or not. For instance,
it is only quite lately that anything like complete
official statistics have been obtainable in relation to internal
manufactures. The country regarded itself, as it was
regarded abroad, as purely agricultural in the broad sense
including Live Stock production. Now these statistics are
regularly issued by the “Division of Commerce and Industry”
so admirably directed and watched over by Señor
Ricardo Pillado; a veteran the list of whose valuable
economic services to the State dates from the financial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
renaissance which followed the disastrous year 1891; in
which renaissance he played a very leading part.</p>

<p>Señor Pillado was largely instrumental in the devising and
carrying into execution of the drastic financial remedies
rendered necessary by the culminating abuses of the Juarez
Celman regime; and it is to his practical and patriotic
genius that the Argentine statistical diagrams and many
other statistics of that country reproduced in this book owe
their existence and annual reappearances in the simple and
striking forms which is their very salient feature.</p>

<p>The total value of the Agricultural Exports during 1914

1915 to some $320,000,000 (gold) during the latter year.</p>

round figures at:</p>

</table>

<p>The Maize crop is as yet unascertained at the time of
writing.</p>

<p>The corresponding Uruguayan figures are as yet unobtainable.
The Statistical Department of this Republic
was reorganized in 1912, but, no doubt, has had to cope
with enormous arrears. Still it is regrettable that authoritative
statistics regarding this country are difficult, when not
impossible, to obtain.</p>

<p>In 1913 Uruguay exported agricultural products of the
value of $(Uruguayan) 1,857,000. 400,000 hectares in Uruguay
were under wheat, a slightly less area under maize; the
cultivation of oats was increasing rapidly, and that of barley
slowly.</p>

<p>As has already been mentioned, the present (1915-16)
harvests are reported as generally splendid in both countries
though labour presents a serious problem, as do freights and
scarcity of ships for export. Such complications have been
prevalent and are likely to prevail throughout the war.</p>

<h3>THE SOIL</h3>

<p>Naturally, the soil of such a vast area as that covered by
the two Republics of Argentina and Uruguay is varied to an
extent with which a book like the present cannot attempt
to deal adequately. The greatest feature is, however, the
celebrated Pampean formation which obtains over the whole
of the Province of Buenos Aires, the greater parts of the
Provinces of Santa Fé, Córdoba, San Luis and Mendoza, the
National Territory of the Pampa Central, the Republic of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Uruguay, and extends southwards beyond the Argentine
Rio Negro. In many places on this formation there are
also later alluvial deposits.</p>

<p>The lightest soils, those with the smallest proportion of
clay and consequently the loosest, are found in the West,
near the Andes.</p>

<p>Starting from the most sandy western region, the soil
grows more and more compact towards the east, along the
River Paraná, the South of the Province of Santa Fé and
most of the Republic of Uruguay, the Northern part of the
Province of Buenos Aires (where rather heavy soils predominate);
while in the South and South-West, that is to
say the southern portion of the Province of Córdoba, the
National Territory of the Pampa Central and the central
and southern part of the Province of Buenos Aires, the soil
is of lighter, though firmer consistency, than that of the
western part.</p>

<p>The generally salient qualities of the Pampean soil are
richness in humus, deficiency in lime and good proportions
of nitrogen and phosphoric acid. A characteristic feature of
the subsoil is stratified layers of more or less calcareous concretions
known as <span class="smcapuc">TOSCA</span> (tufa or tophos stone). This layer
is sometimes deep down; but in the southern region of the
Province of Buenos Aires, beginning at Tandíl and Azul, it
reaches nearly to the surface, so as to appear immediately
under the soil, thus forming a waterproof subsoil impenetrable
by roots.</p>

<p>The present writer has seen wheat growing on less than
an inch of soil above the tosca; the roots spreading out at
right angles to the stalks.</p>

<p>These layers of tosca or, in other parts, clay, are of great
importance for holding water; seldom at any great distance
from the surface.</p>

<p>On low and level plains when the soil is light or loose,
chains of sand-hills are formed by the prevailing winds. Some
of these are kept stationary by quick-growing vegetation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
while others are constantly shifting. The shifting sandhill
is, however, fast disappearing in consequence of the advances
of pastoral industry; for, and by, which they are
becoming fixed by herbaceous growth.</p>

<p>The tosca and clay subsoils have in many parts occasioned
the formation of lagoons and swamps; the waters of which
are, usually, at least brackish and often salt. A white or
grey efflorescence seen in these swamps is locally called saltpetre,
but in fact it only contains slight traces of nitre.</p>

<p>Towards the extreme North of the Province of Entre Rios
and the Republic of Uruguay red soil heralds one’s approach
to subtropical or tropical vegetation.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">LIVE STOCK</span></h2>

<p>General Mitre, in his <cite>History of Belgrano</cite>, has
said of the River Plate Territories:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The natural pastures invited the inhabitants to the
pastoral industry. The vast littoral placed the country in contact
with the rest of the world by means of fluvial and maritime navigation.
Its salubrious and temperate climate rendered life more
pleasant and work more reproductive. It was indeed a territory
prepared for live-stock breeding, constituted for commercial prosperity,
and predestined by acclimatization to be peopled by all the
races of the earth. Thus we see that the profitable occupation of its
soil commences to be realized by means of live stock brought overland
from Peru and from Brazil; that the commercial currents
of the interior converge little by little towards the River Plate;
that abundance and well-being are spread by this means; and
that the first external act of the colonists after the foundation
of Buenos Aires in 1580 is the exportation of a shipload of the
fruits of their own work (hides and sugar), which awakens immigration
and the commerce of importation.</p>

</div>

<p>This reference to the “commerce of importation” is an
indication of the limitations under which the colonists
laboured under Spanish rule. They might import from
Spain as much as they could, but a very jealous guard was
put on their exports lest these might compete with the
industries of the Mother Country.</p>

<p>Seventy-two horses and mares were landed by Pedro de
Mendoza when he founded the first settlement of Santa Maria
de los Buenos Aires in 1535. Many of his followers were
killed by the native Indians, but when Juan de Garay coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
down through Paraguay laid the real foundations of the
present capital of the Argentine Republic, he and those with
him were surprised to find wild horses grazing on the Pampa.
These were the descendants of those brought by Mendoza
and the ancestors of the present equine stock of the River
Plate countries, a stock which has, however, in common with
all the live stock of these countries, been improved out of
all recognition in the course of the last half-century by imported
European strains. Still the wild descendants of
Mendoza’s animals, acclimatized through countless generations
and become hardy in their free life, were no bad raw
material to improve upon.</p>

<p>The first appearance of cattle on the River Plate Pampa
is, as has already been mentioned, credited to seven cows
and a bull said to have been brought from Brazil, through
Paraguay, by two Portuguese, the brothers Cipriano and
Vicente Goes, early in the last half of the sixteenth century,
but other cattle were introduced in far larger quantities
about the same time or a little later under the conditions of
the appointment of Juan de Galazary Espinoza as Treasurer
of the River Plate. To Nunflo de Chaves is credited the
honour of the introduction of the first goats and sheep in
1550.</p>

<p>Evidently large numbers of horses, cattle and sheep afterwards
strayed in a semi-wild condition down south from Peru
and Brazil, attracted by the wealth of pasturage.</p>

<p>The early history of the export trade of the River Plate
colonists in hides, tallow, wool and jerked beef, is one of
smuggling and bribery of officials. Nevertheless, even under
such difficult circumstances and costly methods many
settlers contrived, by also trading in European merchandise,
to amass great wealth, the fortunes of many of them, says
Mr. Gibson, amounting to over £60,000 sterling.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the increase of cattle was astounding if one did
not consider the difficulties in the way of its utilization. In
the middle of the seventeenth century anyone could take all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
he wanted from the wild herds up to 10,000 or 12,000
head, or more by obtaining licence to do so from the
Governor.</p>

<p>The rights of free export of animal produce from Buenos
Aires to Spain and open trade with the interior were first
granted to the River Plate Colonies in 1778, under the Vice-Regal
rule. But it was the Independence of the Colonies in
1810 which freed them from all commercial trammels and
was the real commencement of their present agricultural and
pastoral prosperity. Since then no events (except, of course,
the advent of the railway in 1857) in the annals of the export
commerce of the River Plate have been of greater importance
than the founding of the Argentine Rural Society in 1866,
and the discovery by Tellier of the preservation of meat at
freezing point submitted to the Paris Academy of Science in
1872, and of Ferdinand Carré’s improvements for the transport
of <em>chilled</em> meat.</p>

<p>The first freezing establishment in the River Plate was
that erected by Señor Eugenio Terrasson at San Nicolás, in
the Province of Buenos Aires, in 1883, and in the following
year the legislature exempted frozen and chilled meat from
the payment of export duty.</p>

<p>Over 99% of the whole exports of frozen and chilled meat
from Argentina comes direct to the United Kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and we
get quite one-half of the whole of our overseas meat and
grain supplies from the two River Plate Republics.</p>

<p>The past half-century has seen amazing changes on the
vast pasture lands of Argentina and Uruguay. The first of
these was the invasion of what had formerly been the exclusive
domains of cattle and sheep by agriculture. Little by
little, wheat, especially, ousted the flocks and herds from an
ever-increasing radius from the port of Buenos Aires. Land
values increased as agriculture flourished till the time came
when stock-breeders found themselves outbidden by wheat-growers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
or, rather, landowners found it more profitable to
grow wheat or maize on lands which were economically
accessible to transport. As the railways grew so did this
almost exclusively cereal area.</p>

<p>This tendency continued until what may almost be termed
the “discovery” in the River Plate Territories of the
qualities of Alfalfa (Lucerne).</p>

<p>The double value of this crop as fodder and for improving
the land by collecting and depositing atmospheric nitrogen,
caused it to be planted by every intelligent estanciero, and
brought back much of the cattle to properties which had
seemed for ever given over to wheat-growing. Other
contemporary reasons for the reappearance of cattle on the
home lands were the increased demand for good slaughter
animals initiated by the newly established cold-storage and
export business and dawning appreciation of the fact that
one cannot for ever go on growing immediately successive
crops of wheat on the same land.</p>

<p>Thus were laid some foundations of scientific farming on
more civilized lines, in which stock-raising and agriculture
combine for the profit of the farmer. The cattle industry
and horse-breeding also, gained fresh impetus from the
abundance of alfalfa now grown everywhere on a large scale
and on brackish land formerly considered valueless.</p>

<p>Sheep only, with their nomadic nature which demands
large areas on which to roam, their close-cropping manner
of grazing and their faculty for quickly ruining alfalfa fields
on which they may be allowed to graze, are still only found
in comparatively small numbers on the high-priced lands of
the East-Central parts of Argentina and the South of
Uruguay, being chiefly relegated to outlying districts in
which land is still of comparatively small value and
particularly, in Argentina, to those parts of Patagonia
the inclement climate of which suits them as it does little
else.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the finest breeds of sheep are chiefly to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
found on the “model” estancias, where as good live stock as
any in the world is bred and intensive farming has begun to
be appreciated for its own sake and on account of the
normally ever-increasing value of land in all the most
fertile and accessible rural districts of the River Plate
Republics.</p>

<p>Durhams and Lincolns are the favourite breeds of cattle
and sheep, though many fine strains of Herefords, Polled
Angus, Merinos, Romney Marsh and Shropshires abound.
No price is too high for the Argentine estanciero to pay for
imported animals for the still greater perfection of his stock,
and the great Show held under the auspices of the Rural
Society at Palermo, a park-like suburb of the city of Buenos
Aires, comes as a revelation to each expert breeder who
travels, as many do every year, from Europe to the River
Plate to see it. Money and care can do no better anywhere in
the production of animals of the very highest quality. It
may be noted that the prizes (always awarded by impartial
foreign, usually British, judges) are more frequently gained
by native Argentine breeders.</p>

<p>River Plate live stock suffers very little indeed from any
of the diseases which are the breeder’s dread in most other
countries; with the exception of sheep and pigs, the former
being greatly subject to “fluke” and the latter to fever.
Horse-breeding is carried on very successfully. The carriage
horses exported by Señor Martinez de Hoz and others are
now well known in Europe and the race-courses of Argentina
and Uruguay are the constant scenes of the display of very
fine horse-flesh indeed. That Argentine-bred race-horses are
more successful in South America than freshly imported ones
is no doubt due to climatic causes. Argentine race-horses
are here specified because horse-breeding has been brought
to a higher pitch of perfection in Argentina than has yet
been attained in Uruguay.</p>

<p>Poultry and pig farming may yet be said to be in their
infancy in both Republics, simply because both countries are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
still quite fully occupied with the two great established
industries of producing grain and meat for export.</p>

<p>Given adequate population (how often must one ring the
changes on this phrase!) very many rich sources of prosperity
would quickly be disclosed to now almost unsuspecting
European eyes. Poultry and pigs are two of the richest,
and the most obvious for mention, in this chapter, of such
almost latent sources.</p>

<p>The cold-storage establishment at Zárate, in the Province
of Buenos Aires, some years ago erected a scientifically
equipped plant for the curing of hams and bacon. But the
difficulty is yet to obtain sufficient pigs of first quality to
make the curing industry a success. Throughout the
temperate zone of South America the climatic conditions
are quite favourable to pig-raising; and food in the shape
of maize and alfalfa is abundant at relatively small cost.
When pigs and poultry receive the care which is now
acknowledged to be necessary to, and given for, the best
results from cattle, horses and sheep, River Plate poultry
and pig produce will loom large on the markets of the world,
besides supplying a daily increasing local demand.</p>

<p>What has been called the Alfalfa region because of the
astounding yield of that forage given by its brackish, saltpetre-impregnated
waters and sandy soil, lies to the West of
the Province of Buenos Aires. Almost the whole of the
two Republics are now, however, largely planted with
alfalfa, the spread of which has grown rapidly since the
several valuable qualities of that crop have come to be
understood.</p>

<p>In many districts wheat has been sown on wheat year after
year ever since the booming times of South American cereal
export began. So that in many parts of such districts the
soil can do no more, and in consequence the wheat yield has
become unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>When these districts cease entirely to be able to yield any
wheat at all, someone will lay down alfalfa as an alternate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
crop and will find the cost of having done so, and of reploughing,
say, three years afterwards, insignificant compared
with the value of the quantity and quality of wheat the
same land will yield after that process of alternation; not
to mention the value of the three years’ three or quite
likely four, annual crops of alfalfa taken off it during that
period.</p>

<p>This form of intensive farming will probably be the
first to become obligatory, for economic reasons, on the
generality of owners of land situated in the chief cereal
areas.</p>

<p>Till to-day, landowners in these large favoured tracts have
grown wealthy with little trouble and no thought as far as
purely agricultural enterprise, as apart from stock-breeding,
is concerned.</p>

<p>All this is, however, a digression from our present consideration
of stock-raising, except as regards the increasingly
intimate connection between stock-raising and agriculture
in the most thickly populated districts; for the Argentine
Rural Statistics (more availably complete than those of
Uruguay) show that the much greater proportion of cattle
is in the Provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fé, Córdoba and
Entre Rios which are four of the chief cereal areas. And
though there are more cattle in the province of Corrientes
than in either of the three last-named Provinces, the vast
herds of one of the largest meat-extract companies account
for much of this. So that it may be taken that the Provinces
of Buenos Aires (represented by a long way by the highest
figures), Santa Fé, Córdoba and Entre Rios, with the Territory
of the Pampa Central in respect of cereals, are the
regions which, together, are the richest in Live Stock and
cereals in Argentina.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The 1908 Census showed that more than one-fourth of the
whole cattle of the Republic were Durhams, rather less than
one-sixth Herefords and the remainder made up of very
much smaller quantities of Polled Angus, Dutch, Red
Polled, Jerseys, Flemish and Swiss, their numerical importance
being according to the order in which they are here
stated, from a total of 125,829 Polled Angus to 3401 Swiss.</p>

<p>As has been said, Lincolns are still in most favour among
sheep, followed by Romney Marsh and other long-wool
breeds, Shropshire, Hampshire and Oxford Downs, Southdowns
and Rambouillets and Merinos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The reason for the great preference shown for Durhams is
their reputation for combined meat-carrying and milking
qualities, in which latter Herefords are relatively deficient.
The dairy industries are already developing on an important
scale.</p>

<p>There are practically no parts of the River Plate Territories
except their forests, mountains and certain as yet unirrigated
tracts, such as the Valley of the Rio Negro, which are not
naturally adapted to cattle or sheep raising, or both, and at
present Live Stock is to be found in almost exclusive occupation
of close on 96,000,000 hectares out of the calculated
total of 300 million hectares of cultivable land in the Argentine
Republic. These figures are taken from the 1908
Argentine Census, above referred to.</p>

<p>The parallel figures for Uruguay are not available in such
exact form of statement, but it may be taken that there are
very few parts of that country in which cattle or sheep or
both are not found.</p>

<p>Diseases of live stock are, as has been said, very conspicuous
by their relative total absence in both Republics,
and farmers in both Argentina and Uruguay are very sore
about the sustained attitude of the British Government
which refuses to permit the entrance of River Plate live
stock on the hoof into British ports. The farmers are convinced
that this refusal is due to the influence of British
breeders who, while thus preventing what would otherwise
be a serious menace to their own industry, yet benefit by the
South American acceptance of very high priced animals
imported from Great Britain for stud purposes. The weak
point of this argument is, of course, that such importation
of prize animals is in no way authoritatively enforced on the
Argentine or Uruguayan, his obligation to purchase such
animals arising only from his necessity to do so in his own
best interests. The danger on his side arises from the
possibility of latent tuberculosis and other disease, but this
he now guards very effectually against, often at much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
pecuniary loss to himself, by severe tests carried out by
competent veterinary surgeons on all imported animals and
the unhesitating sacrifice of any found to be infected.</p>

<p>The present writer is inclined to venture the opinion that
the British Government might rely with safety on the
certificates of Argentine and Uruguayan Government experts
of the immunity of all cattle and sheep leaving either
Republic on the hoof. It does, in effect, accept such certificates
in regard to the condition of frozen or chilled carcases;
and, morality apart, it may safely be taken that every
Argentine and Uruguayan interested is much too fully aware
of the importance to himself individually of the countries’
export trade to risk the slightest laxity in connection with
the sure ascertainment of perfect immunity from disease or
contagion of all animals shipped from his Ports.</p>

<p>As this matter now stands, the British authorities refuse
to permit the importation of live cattle or sheep until such
time as the Argentine or Uruguayan Governments can give
assurance of the <em>total absence</em> of disease in <em>every</em> part of their
Republics.</p>

<p>It can easily be understood that this practically postpones
such permission to the Millennium, since it is most highly
improbable that the whole of such vast areas of pasturage
and the millions of head of live stock in Argentina and
Uruguay should ever be without one beast affected in more
or less degree by any contagious disease. One day, probably
(before the Millennium), other counsels will prevail with the
British Government and the whole people of Great Britain,
as well as Argentine and Uruguayan estancieros benefit by
the removal of the present comprehensive prohibition.</p>

<p>For his stock, the Argentine and Uruguayan farmer does
not fear disease, that he and his Governments can and do
very efficiently guard against, but he does fear drought
which he yet has only inadequate means to combat.</p>

<p>The streams of the huge Pampean flat are few and far
between, and are apt to dry up in exceptionally dry seasons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Almost everywhere now the sky-line is dotted with corrugated-iron
windmills which draw water from surface or
artesian wells. But vast and costly irrigation (and drainage)
works are needed before the whole available pasturage of
the two Republics can defy the recurrence of times of drought
which sometimes much more than decimate the live stock of
enormous districts. Uruguay is, however, infinitely better
provided with running rivers and streams than Argentina.</p>

<p>It was a long time before the native Argentine small
farmer could be got to see the real economy of outlay on
artesian wells and still in the more illiterate outlying Provinces
are to be found men as yet unconvinced in that regard.</p>

<p>One of the agricultural instructors which the Argentine
Government keeps travelling all over the country to give
advice and instruction to farmers told the present writer
not so very long ago that he had tried very hard but
without success to persuade a man in a remote corner of
Argentina, whose stock was daily dying of drought, to sink
at least one artesian well on his property, and even offered
to erect a windmill for him free of all cost except that of the
actual mill.</p>

<p>At last, one evening, the farmer consented to this proposal,
but the following morning brought a cloudy sky. Pointing
dramatically to this he said, “Why should I sink wells?
See! Rain is coming.” After that, my friend, the expert,
gave the matter up in disgust. It was of no use telling the
farmer that drought might come again. Sufficient for the
day had been the evil thereof; and, as for future troubles,
why meet them half-way?</p>

<p>Uruguay is relatively very rich in sheep, which thrive
well on her undulating lands, and exports wool to the
annual value of well over £4,000,000.</p>

<p>The value of Argentine annual wool exports now totals
over £9,000,000.</p>

<p>The real commencement of the pastoral as well as the
agricultural industries of the River Plate in systematized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
form was the introduction of fences by a landowner named
Olivera, in 1838. As may be conjectured, the erection of
boundaries where none had ever been before, on properties the
titles to and limits of which were of the vaguest description,
mostly partook of the nature of an arbitrary proceeding.
So evidently thought Manuel Rozas, the tyrant; who
summarily prevented Olivera from continuing the fencing
the latter had begun on his estancia “Los Remedios,”
although Olivera’s new boundaries were but ditches crowned
with quick-set hedges of “Añapinday” (<i>Acacias affinis</i>).</p>

<p>After the death of Rozas, however, in 1844, an English
estanciero, Richard Newton, first employed iron wire for
some of the enclosures of his property; and, later, another
landowner, named Halbach, completely enclosed the whole
of his estancia.</p>

<p>The founder of the Argentine Rural Society, Dr. Eduardo
Olivera, says in one of his agricultural essays:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To these three men (Olivera, Newton and Halbach) the Republic
owes the transformation of its pastoral and agricultural
industries.</p>

</div>

<p>It was only after the enclosing of lands that refining of
stock became possible. Previously, a stock-owner was
always subject to invasion by stray animals (often in large
numbers) belonging to his neighbours.</p>

<p>Thus, as we have seen, the first step, the introduction of
wire fencing, towards the present development of the Live
Stock industry of the River Plate was initiated by an Englishman,
and it was another Englishman, Mr. John Miller, who,
in 1848, imported from England, for a Mr. White, the owner
of the estancia “La Campana,” <i>Tarquin</i>, the first shorthorn
bull ever seen on the River Plate.</p>

<p>Therefore the River Plate Territories really owe their
pastoral development as well as their railways to the Anglo-Saxon
race.</p>

<p>Some ten years later it became the fashion to import<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
stallions of the carriage and riding kinds; it not being foreseen
that the heavier breeds would also prove useful.</p>

<p>Then came the turn of sheep-breeding; first from imported
Merinos. Later, Rambouillets were introduced and a
little later again the Lincoln began to assert its right to the
predominance it has since attained.</p>

<p>In 1866 the Argentine Rural Society was founded by a few
leading estancieros. Still a private society, its admirable
and constantly progressive efforts, usually crowned with
success, have given it a status which is practically official.</p>

<p>The Society has a Registration Office which keeps
authoritative Herd and Flock Books in which are entered
the pedigrees of all the pure-breed cattle, sheep and horses
in the country whose owners have applied for such registration;
except thoroughbred horses and merino sheep, the
breeders of which last have not yet arrived at the definition
of the purity of that class of sheep. The walls of this Office
are lined with the Herd and Flock Books of the Breeding
Societies of Great Britain and her Colonies, and, as Mr.
Herbert Gibson, himself a prominent member of the Society,
tells us, “there is not in the whole world an analogous office
which covers so diverse and numerous a registration.”</p>

<p>The latest (1908) official Argentine live stock Census gives
the following tables of, respectively, the importation of
pedigree bulls and cows and pedigree rams and ewes, from
1880 to 1907.</p>

<p>Total value of cattle and sheep imported for breeding
purposes during the above indicated period $7,588,780 gold—£1,517,756.
These animals have proved worth vastly
more than the prices paid for them.</p>

<p>Prior to this, in 1858, the first Rural Show was organized
at Palermo. It was not a success. As Dr. Zeballos has
written, “It was held in the midst of public indifference
and passed utterly unnoticed by the press.” However,
it seems to have only been a sort of fair at which
all kinds of other wares jostled some rural produce.
In face of this fiasco it is not surprising that no other
Rural Show was held until thirteen years later; when a
really Rural Show was held in the City of Córdoba.
This appears to have had as much success as was to be
expected after taking difficulties of transport into consideration.</p>

<p>The real commencement, however, of the series of great
annual shows now held at Palermo was made by the Rural
Society in 1875.</p>

<p>The majority of the sheep exhibits are Lincolns and
Merinos.</p>

<p>Fine Pigs and Poultry of all kinds are also to be seen at
these shows, but they are chiefly contributed by the wealthier
estancieros. As has been indicated, the day of pig and
poultry farming on a large practical scale has not yet
dawned on the River Plate.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Gibson shows us, in his valuable Monograph
attached to the Argentine National Agricultural and Live
Stock Census of 1908, that the coming of Cold Storage
establishments, as well as the increase of the export trade
for animals on the hoof, was very largely instrumental in
securing the predominance of the Lincoln breed, most frequently
crossed with merino.</p>

<p>Merino for wool and Lincoln for mutton; and the cross
which preserves the best qualities of both is in effect the
guiding rule of the River Plate sheep-breeder of to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
However, with the coming of alfalfa came also the various
black-faced or Down breeds which mature quickly into fine
meat carcases.</p>

<p>It may be said that barbed wire, iron water-drawing windmills
and cold storage establishments are the chief inanimate
supports of the River Plate Live Stock industries. Another
should be trees; the prime necessity of which to afford
shade for animals which know no other roof but the heavens,
from which a very hot sun shines on the Pampa in summer
time, is not yet as generally appreciated as it should be.
Still the planting of trees on pasture lands began some years
ago, and only could be wished to spread more quickly and
universally than it has yet done.</p>

<p>One is all too apt in dealing with the River Plate Republics
to confine one’s ideas regarding them to industries of a
magnitude commensurate with the huge extent of their
Territories; but with the coming of the real colonist, when
he does come, the mixed farming which, necessarily for his
own comfort, he will bring with him will greatly enhance
the importance of milch breeds of cattle, pigs, poultry and
the produce of the kitchen garden in the rural economy of
the River Plate.</p>

<p>The average annual value of the Live Stock products of
Uruguay during the five years ending 1913 was $39,682,850
(Uruguayan) = £8,443,315. Similarly with Cereal Exports,
Live Stock Exports dropped in 1914, but have more than
recovered during 1915. Evidently, however, no War-time
Export Statistics can be taken as indications of the true
productiveness of the countries concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE MEAT TRADE</h3>

<p>The export of Meat from the River Plate Territories is no
new thing; the first of such exports being authorized by
Philip III of Spain in 1602.</p>

<p>The export under this edict was entirely confined to jerked
beef; the salting industry only obtaining important
development considerably later. It was not until 1793 that
we find another Royal Edict which granted freedom from
Export and Import duties for the salted meat and tallow
of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>About three-fourths of the exports under these Edicts
usually went to Havana and the remainder to Spain.</p>

<p>The next development of this industry was begun when
in 1841 a certain Hipolito Doinnel established a salting
factory at the foot of the Cerro at Montevideo; at which he
also manufactured soap, candles and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>During all this period the export of hides was constantly
much greater than that of meat.</p>

<p>The first mention of the export of horse hair relates to the
year 1585, when from 300 to 400 mares were ordered to be
killed so that their tails might be sent to the Guinea coast
to be bartered for slaves.</p>

<p>The first privilege or patent granted in the now already
independent River Plate Territories for meat preservation
was granted by the Congress at Paraná, in 1854, to one
Samuel Laffone Quevedo for the exclusive use of a machine
invented by him for the preparation and pressing of salted beef.</p>

<p>Further experiment in preservation, by either heat, cold
or in a vacuum, led to many local patents being granted for
various processes from the year 1867 onward, to the present
day in fact; in respect of alternative systems or suggested
improvements of those generally in use.</p>

<p>The historic beginning, however, of the present River
Plate Meat Industry was made in the year 1877 in the spring
of which <i>La Frigorifique</i> and in the autumn of which <i>La
Paraguay</i>, specially fitted boats, sailed from Buenos Aires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
with cargoes of meat preserved by the freezing and chilling
systems discovered by Mr. Charles Tellier.</p>

<p>Thus, while in the past the River Plate Territories exported
only sun-dried meat for the slaves on the Brazilian
and Havana sugar plantations, now they supply meat to the
most highly civilized and exacting countries of the world.</p>

<p>The free export of frozen meat was sanctioned by the
Argentine Congress in 1884, two years after the first of the
existing cold storage establishments in Argentina had been
started by Mr. Alfred Drabble. An establishment which
still continues to carry on business successfully under the
control of “The River Plate Fresh Meat Company.”</p>

<p>Other large companies which exploit this industry are the
Sansinena “La Negra” (est. 1883), the “Las Palmas
Produce Co.” (est. 1892), the “La Plata Cold Storage Co.”
(est. 1902), the “La Blanca” Cold Storage (est. 1902), the
Sansinena “Cuatreros” (est. 1903), “The Smithfield and
Argentine Meat Co.” (est. 1905), and the “Frigorifico” (est.
1905).</p>

<p>The Meat Trade recognizes an average difference of weight
between Argentine and Uruguayan beef and between
Argentine, Uruguayan and “Patagonian” mutton. Argentine
quarters of beef run about 12 to the ton and Uruguayan
about 14 to the ton. Argentine mutton carcases run about
40, Uruguayan about 45 to the ton, and mutton carcases
from Patagonia (in Argentina) some 2 or 3 lbs. lighter than
Uruguayan.</p>

<p>Already in March, 1915, British Trade Reports showed
that the meat trade in Great Britain was particularly dull
on account of the extremely high prices ruling and the impossibility
of retailers being able to get an equivalent in their
shops. Since then, through the fact of the Governments of

<p>During 1914 the meat producers and importers were
alarmed by the purchase of most of the chief River Plate
cold storage establishments by United States companies,
who were credited with the intention of forming a “combine”
to monopolize the industry. Certainly at the commencement
of 1914 they were paying high prices to estancieros and
selling considerably increased exports at low prices in the
British markets. It would appear, however, as if matters
were in the course of adjustment between all the River Plate
Cold Storage companies when the War came and, as has
just been indicated, altered all the conditions of the meat
markets.</p>

<p>For all the above causes it is difficult to assign a <em>value</em><a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
to recent River Plate Meat Exports. Exports which it
must be remembered leave no record as having paid <i lang="la">ad
valorem</i> export duty, since they are duty-free exports.</p>

<p>As for the future of this trade there can be little doubt but
that it will continue to increase commensurately with the
available quantity of live stock of high quality. The Cold
Storage Companies will buy no other and thus have constantly
encouraged and advanced scientific breeding on the
River Plate. It may safely be assumed that this trade is
not likely to lose by the occurrence or effects of the War.</p>

<p>Recently, in view of what seemed a threatened shortage
of cattle for export demands, producers commenced breeding
from one-year-old cows; instead of beginning only at two
years of age, as formerly was the South American custom.</p>

<p>Not only do the Cold Storage Companies export Meat but
they also work up into marketable forms the various by-products
of the animals they slaughter.</p>

<p>Did anyone ever hear of Argentine timber? Few
people indeed; though a good many more know
that both of the River Plate Republics are large
importers of wood from the North of Europe. That they
need not be so, because they have all they, and a good many
other countries besides, can possibly need already growing
in their own territories (and as much more as may be
wanted, only for the trouble of planting under highly
favourable natural conditions), will come as a surprise even
to some Argentines and Uruguayans; so accustomed are
they to import all their building timber and furniture. Yet
the above are facts.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The only well-known forestal products of the River Plate
are the logs of and extract from the <span class="smcap">Quebracho</span> (<i>Aspidosperma
Quebracho</i>, Schlet). The wood of this tree is very
hard—hence its name quebra-hacha, break-axe—and is
valuable for cabinet-making, fine carving, and engraving,
etc.; but it rots quickly when exposed to the influences of
weather. Notwithstanding this, on account of its hardness,
it is in large demand for railway sleepers. The extract
is very largely used for tanning.</p>

<p>The following lists and descriptions given by Señor
Fernando Mauduit in his erudite Monograph on “Arboriculture
in Argentina,” attached to the Argentine National
Census, 1908, cannot, certainly, be improved on by the present
author. These lists, although confined to the enumeration
of the chief classes of trees only, are at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
fully indicative of the general nature of forest vegetation
not only in Argentina but also in Uruguay.</p>

<p>A glance at the map of both Republics will show that, from
geographic and climatic distribution, they may practically
be reckoned as one country in this regard. Indeed, as will
be seen, Señor Mauduit specifically includes Uruguay in
what he terms the Riparian Region. He says that the configuration
of the different zones and the fertility of their
soil allow of the cultivation of every product of the two
Americas, Asia, Europe and Australia, with the exception
of those of the torrid zone.</p>

<p>The following enumeration of “regions” and of the chief
kinds of trees found and capable of being grown in the River
Plate countries, with the respective descriptions, are taken
from the Monograph above referred to:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Subtropical</span>, comprising the plains of Santiago del Estero
and the Chaco, the lowlands of Tucumán, Salta and Jujuy,
North Corrientes and Misiones.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Northern Andean</span>, stretching along the Andes, from San
Juan to the Bolivian frontier, comprising Catamarca, Salta,
Jujuy, Los Andes and part of Tucumán.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Southern Andean</span>, from San Juan to Neuquen.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Northern Pampean</span>, from Santiago del Estero to Buenos
Aires, wherein the eucalyptus trees do not suffer from frost, and
comprising Córdoba, San Luis, part of Santa Fé and Buenos
Aires.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Southern Pampean</span>, comprising Córdoba and San Luis,
where the eucalyptus freezes, Southern Buenos Aires and the
Pampas.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Austral</span>, composed of the territories of Rio Negro, Chubut
and Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Riparian</span>, comprising the islands of the Paraná, Entre Rios
and the shores of the rivers Plate, Paraná and Uruguay.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Maritime</span>, stretching along the Atlantic coast in a belt
three leagues wide, more or less, according to the configuration
of the soil.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">Straits</span>, consisting of the shores of the Straits of Magellan
and Tierra del Fuego.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>The confines of all these regions cross and merge into one
another, at times, on account of the altitude in their different
zones. The vegetation typical of one zone is often scattered
through one or more neighbouring ones, so that they cannot be
exactly defined. The greater or lesser altitude of a place often
goes towards modifying the uniform character of the vegetation.</p>

<p>In the first region the forests contain the best timber in the
Republic, cedar or hardwood, so-called (cedrela) quebracho
white and red, lapacho, algarrobo (carob), acacia, ibirá, molle,
ñandubay, different woods, Misiones pine, Brazilian araucaria,
tarco, urunday, aguaribay, cebil, timbó, palm trees, etc., and
the fruit trees of the region, orange, lemon, pomegranate, guava,
chirimoyas (custard apple) and pantas.</p>

<p>Fruit tree planting, though seldom, is more carefully done
than formerly, and its products inundate the markets of Buenos
Aires, Rosario and Santa Fé.</p>

<p>The Paraguayan tea tree, or rather bush (mate), is grown in
many places and cultivated rationally. Mr. Thays’ experiments
give room for hoping that this precious bush may become a certain
source of future wealth, whereas the old system of cultivation
was bound to entail, early or late, the total extinction of the
product.</p>

<p>All kinds of eucalyptus trees grow well, and the extensive
planting of these trees in the Chaco, Misiones, in Tucumán, Corrientes
and Santiago del Estero is a consummation devoutly
to be wished for.</p>

<p>The same trees are found in the second region, but fewer
in number and smaller in size, orange, lemon, fig, plum, peach
and pomegranate trees, also the vine can be successfully grown,
and in the valleys guayavos, chirimoyas, pantas, avocados and
persimmons. Plantations of mate and eucalyptus could also be
tried.</p>

<p>The third region is warmer and partly covered with vineyards.
Here the vine is in its native element.</p>

<p>On the slopes of the Andes the soil is admirably suited for the
planting of forest trees, such as pines, firs, beeches, and all others
peculiar to mild, dry climates; as well as for that of fruit trees,
such as the walnut, chestnut, apple, cherry, pear and peach
trees … the vine where late frosts are not very frequent.</p>

<p>In the Northern Pampas, or the fourth region, all kinds of
fruit trees can be grown, soil permitting, orange, fig, persimmon,
vines, mulberry, almond, peach, apricot, plum, cherry, walnut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
chestnut, pear and quince trees. This is the forest tree region
of the plains: hardwood, native willows, the paradise tree, ombú,
laurel, sequoia, cypress, sycamore, maple and many others. The
caldén tree covers immense stretches, likewise the carob tree.</p>

<p>The fifth or Southern Pampean region differs from the preceding
one in the cooler and even colder climate in its southern
part. Apart from the trees which suffer from frosts this is the
most favourable zone for tree cultivation in general. All forest
trees which resist 10° below zero grow well here, the oak, beech,
ash, maple, pine, fir, spruce, poplar, elm, sycamore and such fruit
trees as the peach, cherry, plum, apricot, quince, pear and apple
tree.</p>

<p>These two regions are those containing the largest plantations
of trees of all kinds, millions of eucalyptus trees, farms, parks
and gardens, richly stocked, representing millions of dollars, and
ever-increasing and multiplying orchards and groves which bring
in thousands, but whose output could be increased tenfold
without succeeding in ousting the preserved fruit imported from
Europe and North America.</p>

<p>The sixth or Austral region, as its name indicates, is exposed
to the south winds. It is the cold region which excludes the
eucalyptus, the Californian pine, and peach tree, the vine, etc.,
but where in sheltered spots the cherry, plum, pear and apple
tree can be grown, the last especially. This, once known, would
make the fortune of this region. Cider manufacture would
furnish a wholesome, pleasant beverage, much cheaper than
wine.</p>

<p>Moreover, the preparation of apple preserves of every kind
will one day be like that of North America. The man who plants
apple trees, beginning from 38° S. latitude to the south, secures
for himself and his children returns proportionate to the outlay
made.</p>

<p>The seventh region is very fertile and suited for the planting
of willows, poplars, alders, cryptomerias, cypresses, sycamores,
magnolias, palm trees, orange trees, tangerines, persimmons, etc.
Peach and quince trees are grown here on a large scale to supply
the markets of the capital. It has been the cradle of fruit-growing,
and as it has been endowed with a mild climate and a generally
humid soil everything grows luxuriantly and produces
abundantly, though the general quality of its products is not
equal to that of the fruit grown in the fifth region.</p>

<p>The eighth region is arid in certain places, and always exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
to the winds and sea fogs which are so harmful to the growth of
the trees. The winds from the south blow throughout the year
on nearly all our sea coast. The only trees that can be grown
successfully are the eucalyptus (<i>E. globulus</i>), the Canadian and
other poplars, the tamarisk, cypress, lambertiana, maritime pine,
<i>Pinus insignis</i>, and all must be planted very thickly in order to
resist the impetuous attack of the winds and the fogs.</p>

<p>In the ninth and last region we have included the shores of
the Straits of Magellan as far as Gallegos, and inland as far as
the hills; and on the other shore Fireland (Tierra del Fuego).
Fruit tree planting cannot be thought of there for the present,
the only thing to be done is to propagate largely the native
growths, and where the climate permits it to plant spruces, pines,
firs, birches, beeches, hazels, currant bushes, yews, all of which
are sturdy growths of the colder countries.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chief Indigenous Species of Forest Trees</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Quebracho</span>, <i>Aspidosperma Quebracho</i>, Schlet.—A tree 20
metres in height by 1 metre in diameter, with very hard wood,
greatly valued for certain purposes. Does not resist exposure
to the elements, however, and rots easily. Greatly prized for
engraving and cabinet-making and for fine wood carving, etc.
The bark and leaves are rich in tannin. It appears that there are
some varieties which do not possess so large a percentage of
tannin.</p>

<p>It grows easily from seed which is sown in beds when ripe,
where it must be nursed before sowing in beds. Its growth is
slow at first, but once the roots have taken well in a soil rich in
humus it attains a great size. It multiplies naturally from its
seeds and should form a third as a stock tree in the afforestation
of the subtropical regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boldu</span>, <i>Boldu chilanum</i>, Nees.—Grows to a height of 15 metres
in the Andean regions, where its timber is used for various
purposes. It multiplies from seed and should be sown in beds
in holes. Can be utilized as an auxiliary in afforestation of its
native region.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lignum Vitæ</span> (Palo Santo), <i>Bulnesia Sarmienti</i>, Grisb.—20
metres in height by 0·75 metre in diameter. Grows plentifully
in the Chaco and Misiones, Tucumán, Salta and Jujuy, gives a
timber, heavier than water, which is used for cabinet-making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and various ornaments. Multiplies easily from seed as an
auxiliary in subtropical woods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palo Blanco</span>, <i>Calycophyllum multiflorum</i>, Grisb.—About
15 metres in height, gives very fine timber, yellow in colour, used
for different joinery purposes. Multiplies from seed like the
preceding tree and used also as an auxiliary in the same
regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horco Molle</span>, <i>Bumelia obtusiolia</i>, Roem and Schlet.—12
metres in height by O·50 metre in diameter. Furnishes excellent
timber for cabinet-making and coach-building. Multiplies from
seed sown in rows as soon as ripe. In mixed subtropical woods,
it serves as an auxiliary for afforestation and reafforestation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guaicum</span>, <i>Cesalpina melanocarpa</i>, Grisb.—From 10 to 15
metres in height. Gives nice veined timber, used for cabinet-making
and ornaments. Its bark, as well as the seed pods,
contains a large percentage of tannin. It multiplies from seed
and is a secondary tree throughout the subtropical zone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red Cedar</span>, <i>Cedrela brasiliensis</i>, A. Juss.—30 metres in height
by O·75 metre in diameter, and sometimes more. Furnishes
very fine light timber of a nice colour and easy to work. Much
used for joinery work. One of the best stock trees in the subtropical
zone, where it should be used for reafforestation in the
existing woods, and afforestation throughout the subtropical
region. To be sown in rows as far as possible and with seeds in
layers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tala</span>, <i>Celtis tola</i>, Gill, <i>Celtis sellowiana</i>, Miq.—From 10 to 15
metres in height. This tree is of slight importance for afforestation,
although its timber is good for posts, cart-trees, handles
for tools, etc. Grows in the first, second and third regions.
Multiplies from seeds in layers as an auxiliary in mixed woods
and woodlands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palo de Lanza Amarilla</span> (Yellow Lancewood), <i>Chuncoa trifolia</i>,
Grisb.—Same height and regions as the preceding tree.
To be planted in the same woods. The timber is useful for
joinery work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laurel</span>, <i>Emmotum apogon</i>, Grisb.—One of the finest trees of
the subtropical region; over 25 metres in height by O·50 metre
in diameter. The timber is very fine and good, and is useful for
carpentry work. One of the best kinds for reafforestation and
as stock for afforestation. Sown in rows in little holes with
seeds in layers as far as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">White or Yellow Laurel</span>, <i>Oreodaphne suaveolens</i>, Meissn.—30
metres in height by 0·50 metre in diameter. Furnishes light
timber, aromatic, easily worked and suitable for joinery. Is a
good auxiliary for reafforestation and for afforestation in the
first region. Sown like the preceding one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Laurel</span> or <span class="smcap">Mountain Laurel</span>, <i>Nectandra porphyria</i>,
Grisb.—Same height as the preceding trees and 1 metre in diameter.
Gives fine yellow timber with a black grain like walnut,
but requiring a long time to become seasoned, and splitting when
worked before being quite seasoned. Employed in hydraulic
works, as it keeps well in water. A good auxiliary kind for
afforestation in the first, second and fourth regions, the seed
to be sown in little holes, in rows and in layers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Timbó Pacará</span>, <i>Enterolobium timbouva</i>, Mart.—A very leafy
tree of the subtropical region, from 15 to 25 metres in height by
1 to 1·50 metres in diameter. Furnishes timber used for carpentry
and different household purposes, for boats, casks, etc.
The bark contains tannin, and the sawdust of the dry wood
causes sneezing. This is a good auxiliary kind for woods in the
first, second and fourth regions. Multiplies from seeds sown in
holes in rows. It can also be grown from twigs to be planted at
the end of May, a metre apart, in rows of from 1 to 3 metres
apart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beech</span>, <i>Fagus antarctica</i>, Mirb., <i>F. betuloides</i>, Mirb., <i>F. oblicua</i>,
Mirb.—A tree of 20 to 30 metres in height, peculiar to the
austral regions, where it forms forests and woods. Its timber
does not resist damp greatly, but is much prized for box-making
and internal woodwork. Multiplies easily from its seeds, which
grow naturally in its shade. When they are gathered to be used
for afforestation they must be sown at once in layers, or in little
holes, as their germinative power is soon lost. Is one of the best
kinds of stock trees for afforestation in the 6th and 9th regions
and for reafforestation where it already grows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larch</span>, <i>Fitz-roya patagonica</i>, Hook.—This conifer of the woods
of the south attains a height of 30 metres, and the timber given
by it is equal to pinewood and used for similar purposes. Is very
suitable for afforestation intermingled with wild pines in the
austral region, and with spruce in that of the straits. It might
also be added to the araucaria in the extreme south of the
Southern Andean region.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quillay</span> (Soap Bark), <i>Garugandra amorphoides</i>, Grisb.—This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
is a very thorny tree and can be used as a protective belt round
large orchards or plantations for industrial purposes, in places
where animals trespass, and there is no other way to prevent it.
It attains a height of 15 metres by 0·75 metre in diameter and
multiplies naturally from seed. Its timber seems to be of good
quality, and its bark is used as soap in cleaning woollen and
cotton fabrics.</p>

<p>It can be planted as indicated above in regions first, second
and third; and, should it become a nuisance, it may be rooted
out when the plantations are strong against trespass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chañar</span>, <i>Gourlien decorticans</i>, Gill.—Whole woods of these
trees are to be found in regions 1, 2, 3 and 4. Its fruit is edible
and animals crave for it. Its timber is used for various household
purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walnut</span> (Cayuri), <i>Juglans australis</i>, Grisb.—15 metres in
height by 1 metre in diameter, with timber equal to European
walnut. This valuable tree, which ought to be cultivated on a
large scale, is gradually vanishing from our woods without any
attempt at reafforestation. We shall become aware of its
industrial value only when it has completely disappeared. It is
suitable as a stock tree in afforestation and as an auxiliary in
reafforestation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red Quebracho</span>, <i>Loxopterigium Lorentzii</i>, Grisb.—A valuable
tree, 15 metres in height by 2 metres in diameter, its timber is
greatly prized for building purposes, and possesses so much
tannin that it is largely exploited in the Chaco forests. It is slow
of growth, and, therefore, measures for its multiplication are
indispensable, so as to avoid exhausting this source of wealth.
It is one of the best stock kinds for reafforestation, a third being
planted with species of a more rapid growth. It multiplies
naturally if care is taken to prevent forest fires and to leave
always a few full-grown trees standing. Red Quebracho timber
is hard, heavy, and not easily worked. It is used especially for
railway sleepers, posts, columns, frames, etc. It is nicely veined,
and heavy furniture can be made from it. Buried or in water
it keeps for many years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tipa</span> (Hardwood), <i>Machærium Tipa</i>, Benth.—A tree from
20 to 25 metres in height, very leafy. Its timber is used for
different household purposes. A splendid avenue tree, but very
third-rate as a forest tree. The seeds are sown in rows, once ripe:
1st and 4th regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mora</span> (Mulberry), <i>Maclura Mora</i>, Grisb.—From 15 to 20
metres in height by 1 metre in diameter. Furnishes yellowish,
fine-grained timber, which is used for the manufacture of elegant

stock tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Native</span> or <span class="smcap">Red Willow</span>, <i>Salix Humboldtiana</i>, Witti.—15
metres in height by 1 metre in diameter. Grows well in all
regions where the eucalyptus does not freeze, gives timber for
carpentry and multiplies from seed. A good auxiliary in mixed
woods and timber for cutting, and for reafforestation on damp
soil, where it is planted from twigs towards the end of the winter.
For afforestation it is sown in plots when the seeds are ripe, in
regions 4 and 7 and the more temperate part of region 3.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Southern Pine</span>, <i>Araucaria imbricata</i>, R. and P.—A tree
50 metres in height of our southern forests. Its timber is equal
to the best pine, and it is one of the best stock kinds in the 6th
region. To be sown in rows or in little holes when the seeds
drop naturally in the 5th and 6th regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Misiones Pine</span>, <i>Araucaria brasiliensis</i>, A. Rich.—This conifer

tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cypress</span>, <i>Libocedras chilensis</i>, Endl.—From the Andes, where
it grows to a height of 25 to 30 metres by 0·70 metre in diameter.
Its wood is fine and excels for furniture and veneering. A good
auxiliary kind for the dense woods of the south.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chief Species of Exotic Forest Trees Grown
in the Country</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Fir</span>, <i>Abies Nordmanniana</i>, Spach.—From Asia Minor, where
it grows to a height of 40 metres by 1·50 metres in diameter at
least, 5th and 6th regions, in tall woods consisting of firs alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acacia Olive</span>, <i>Acacia melanoxylon</i>, R. Br.—From Australia,
where it attains a height of 15 to 20 metres by 1 metre in diameter;
very branchy, and giving very hard wood known as
iron wood. A good stock kind in acacia, mimosa and laurel
groves in regions 4, 5, 7 and 8, as far as Mar del Plata. To be
sown in rows or in furrows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">French Mimosa</span>, <i>Acacia dealbata</i>, Link.—Likewise from
Australia; it attains a height of 20 metres by 0·50 metre in
diameter, but breaks easily. A good predominating species and
for reafforestation of timber for cutting, in regions 4, 5, 7 and 8,
as far as 38° S. latitude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maple Tree</span>, <i>Acer pseudo platanus</i>, L.—A European tree
20 to 30 metres in height by 0·75 metre in diameter, growing as
rapidly as the sycamore maple. An excellent auxiliary kind for
tall woods of trees with deciduous leaves, in regions 4, 5, 6 and 7.
To be sown in rows, in furrows or one-year-old saplings 2 metres
apart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heavenly Tree</span>, <i>Ailanthus glandulosa</i>, Desf.—From China,
from 25 to 30 metres in height by 1 metre in diameter; very
sturdy, and multiplying on all sides from the numberless saplings
which grow from its roots; furnishes fine, hard, well-veined
timber. A good kind for mixed woods and for stock timber in
regions 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. To be sown in rows or planted from
saplings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alder Tree</span>, <i>Alnus glutinosa</i>, Gaertn.—From Europe and
Western Asia. From 20 to 30 metres in height by 1 metre in
diameter. Grows well in the riparian region, and its wood is
useful for carpentry. Sown in rows, in furrows or in plots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spanish Chestnut</span>, <i>Castanea vesca</i>, Gaertn.—From Europe,
Asia and Northern Africa. It grows here as a fruit tree, but may
be grown also as a forest stock tree in tall and mixed woods, and
as an auxiliary in timber for cutting in regions 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
Its wood is principally used for staves, casks, etc. To be sown
in rows as soon as it falls, as the germinative power is of short
duration. It may also be sown in nursery beds, for transplanting
when two or three years old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casuarina</span> (She Oak).—Various species are grown here, chief
are <i>C. quadrivalvis</i>, Labill., <i>C. equisetifolia</i>, Forst., and <i>C. glauca</i>,
Sieb. Herb. We ignore the height to which they may grow, but
many specimens we have are from 20 to 30 metres high. The
mode of reproduction and cultivation is the same as for eucalyptus.
The wood is excellent. Suitable for high woods in the
3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cedars.</span>—Although not yet grown on a very large scale, the
specimens we have of <i>C. Atlantica</i>, <i>C. libani</i> and <i>C. deodara</i>,
natives of Mounts Atlas, Lebanon and the Himalayas, are
hardy, cold-resisting, and everything points to our being able
to grow them well in high woods intermingled with cypresses,
in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th regions. Its timber is first class,
and useful for many purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sweet Cherry</span>, <i>Cerasus avium</i>, Moench.—From Europe,
where it grows to a height of 20 to 25 metres, gives splendid wood,
greatly prized for furniture. The few specimens we have scattered
through the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th regions. To be
sown in nursery beds after gathering the seeds, or in layers in
furrows or small holes. The nurslings are transplanted when a
year or two old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cryptomeria Japonica</span>, Don.—From Japan. Grows very
well here, easily attaining the same height as in its native land,
which varies from 30 to 40 metres. A good kind for tall woods on
rich soil. Multiplication and cultivation like that of the eucalyptus
in the 4th, 5th and 7th regions. Trials in the 8th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dammara Australis</span>, Lumb.—From New Zealand. The few
specimens we have in the environs of Buenos Aires show a species
quite as hardy as in its native land, where it attains a height of
50 metres by 2 metres in diameter. Grown like the eucalyptus
in compact groves and in the same region.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eucalyptus.</span>—Native of Australia. We reckon our specimens
of this gigantic tree by the thousand, of several different kinds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
The first known specimens of <i>E. globulus</i> were planted more than
half a century ago, and now it would take a long time to enumerate
all our progressive citizens who have devoted large tracts
of land to forming dense groves of these trees, which, besides
giving them good returns in the sums represented by the present
eucalyptus groves, have also contributed to increase the value
of the land, directly or indirectly. Directly, thanks to the amount
of vegetable mould which these trees originate, and indirectly
for the shelter afforded by them for growing certain kinds of
plants and rearing delicate breeds of cattle which would not have
thriven in the open country. It would be difficult to estimate
the share of the eucalyptus in the increased value of the lands,
flocks and herds. In order to form an idea on the subject one
must imagine what estancias were sixty years ago, with the
sheltering ombú and the peach grove, enclosed by paradise trees
and willows. How long it took to grow a tiny grove of willows,
paradise tree and black wattle, which barely furnished sufficient
wood to heat the water for brewing mate or Paraguayan tea.
Different kinds of Eucalyptus are grown under apocryphal
specific designations, and therefore we abstain from giving them
lest we lead planters into temptation.</p>

<p>The best among them are the following:—</p>

<p><i>E. Amygdalina</i>, Labill.—From Australia and Tasmania,
140 metres in height by 4 or 5 metres in diameter.</p>

<p><i>E. Botrioydes</i>, Smith.—From Southern Queensland, where it
attains a height of 60 metres by 2 metres in diameter.</p>

<p><i>E. diversicolor</i>, F. v. M.—From Southern Australia, 140 metres
in height, over 2 metres in diameter.</p>

<p><i>E. cornuta</i>, Labill.—From the same place as the preceding one,
60 metres in height by 2 metres in diameter.</p>

<p><i>E. hemiphloia</i>, F. v. M.—From New South Wales, where it
attains a height of 60 metres by 2 metres in diameter. The best
wood of all.</p>

<p><i>E. leucoxylon</i>, F. v. M.—From New South Wales and Victoria.
This is the famous “iron bark”; it is only 30 metres in height
by 2 metres in diameter.</p>

<p><i>E. melliodora</i>, Cunningh.—New South Wales and Victoria.
Gives very fine timber and grows to a height of 60 metres by
1·50 metres in diameter. Its blossoms are much visited by
bees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p><i>E. occidentalis</i>, Smith.—From Western Australia. Like
E. globulus, can be grown near the sea coast. Generally it does
not exceed 40 metres in height by 1 metre in diameter.</p>

<p><i>E. pauciflora</i>, Sieb.—Southern Australia and Tasmania.
From 50 to 60 metres in height by 2 metres in diameter, wood of
excellent quality. One of the best cold-resisting species.</p>

<p><i>E. Pilularis</i>, Smith.—Southern Queensland and New South
Wales, 100 metres in height and 4 metres in diameter; wood of
excellent quality.</p>

<p><i>E. viminalis</i>, Labill.—Southern Australia, where it grows to
a height of 100 metres by 3 or 4 metres in diameter.</p>

<p>All these species have been imported and planted in different
places. Some, on the one hand, and others, on the other, probably
have been lost, the remainder are mixed to such a degree
that at present no information can be given about them without
falling into error.</p>

<p>All the species mentioned and some others were planted in
“3 de Febrero” Park, about the year 1875-76, in the clump
which shaded the guanacos’ corral. At first they bore distinguishing
numbers, but now nothing remains to designate
them. Another nursery had been started on the other side of
the railway to the Tigre, beside the avenue of palms, of which
also we believe not a vestige remains. There also was a nursery
of ombús, one of hardwood trees and a collection of American
grape vines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ash Tree</span>, <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>, L.—Europe. From 25 to 30
metres in height by 1 metre in diameter. Gives very elastic,
white or yellow timber, greatly prized in carriage-building.
Grows well in the 5th, 6th and 7th regions. The seeds are laid
down as they ripen, sometimes they take two years to germinate,
but when they fall naturally to the ground and are covered over
by leaves in autumn they sprout well. On this account and that
of its intrinsic value this tree is one of the best kinds for stocking
tall and mixed woods. The best plan for afforestation is to sow
the seeds in nursery beds and plant out the following year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Acacia</span>, <i>Gleditschia triacanthos</i>.—A thorny North
American tree; here growing to a height of 25 metres by 0·70
metre in diameter. Its wood is excellent for cabinet-making.
Sown in rows as an auxiliary—on account of its thorns. It gives
a quantity of edible pods like that of the carob tree. It grows
well in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walnut</span>, <i>Juglans regia</i>, L.—From Europe and Asia. Does
not exceed 25 metres in height, but is a metre and more in
diameter. Grows as a forest tree, but is very suitable for stocking
mixed woods in the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th regions. To be sown
in rows, in holes or in nursery beds and planted out when a
year old. As the seeds keep their germinative power for a month
only, they must be sown immediately or placed in layers. The
wood, which is greatly prized, is one of the best known and
valued.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paradise Tree</span>, <i>Melia azedarach</i>, L.—Southern Asia. 15
metres in height by 0·60 metre in diameter. A good auxiliary
species for mixed woods and timber for cutting in the 3rd, 4th,
6th and 7th regions, where the eucalyptus does not freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Negundo Fraxinifolium</span>, Nutt.—From North America,
growing well in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th regions, where
it attains a height of 10 to 15 metres by 0·50 metre in diameter.
It is a good kind for mixed woods and timber for cutting. The
seeds are sown immediately on ripening. It is also grown from
grafting twigs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fir</span>, <i>Picea excelsa</i>, Linck.—From Europe, where it attains a
height of 40 metres. The few specimens we know do not allow
of our expressing any opinion, based on practical experience,
about the possible merit of this splendid tree in our woods in
the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 9th regions, though its origin and growth
give reason for hope. In Europe, in all the plantations we know
of in Germany, England and France, the fir is one of the best
cold, storm and drought-resisting trees.</p>

<p>It is sown in rows, in furrows 2·50 to 3 metres apart, according
to the soil. It may be planted alone or alternately with birch
trees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pines.</span>—The kind best known and cultivated here are the
<i>Pinus austriaca</i>, <i>P. insignis</i> and <i>P. Pinaster</i>. Without questioning
the specific designation applied to certain kinds of pine
trees, we may say that <i>P. insignis</i> grows luxuriantly in the
4th, 5th and 7th regions, forming dense woods; the <i>P. Canariensis</i>,
not quite so hardy, does not flourish so far south, the other
kinds may be grown in those as well as in the Riparian austral
and maritime regions, where they may prove very useful, as
well as the varieties <i>P. maritima</i>, <i>P. laricio</i>, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plane Tree</span>, <i>Platanus orientalis</i>, L.—From Europe and Asia
Minor. It grows to 40 metres in height by 1 or 2 metres in diameter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
It is the favourite for avenues; grows taller in the woods,
but its foliage is not so luxuriant. Propagated from grafting
twigs to be planted 50 centimetres apart in rows 2·50 metres
apart. To be thinned out when two years old, leaving the latter
distance between them and filling up the gaps with those taken
out. Its wood is useful for many purposes, though not first class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Poplar</span>, <i>Populus</i>.—We have many large plantations of the
Lombardy poplar, <i>P. Nigra</i>, L., Canadian poplar, <i>O. Canadensis</i>,
Michx., and the Swiss, Virginian and some of the Carolina poplar,
which is the male plant of the same species. Some plantations
of the silver poplar, <i>P. alba</i>, <i>P. euphratica</i> and <i>P. simoni</i>, have
also been planted.</p>

<p>All may be utilized as auxiliaries in planting mixed woods and
timber for cutting. They are very hardy, and the wood is used
for packing-cases, boxes, etc. They are planted from grafting
twigs 50 centimetres apart, in rows of 2 metres, to be thinned
out when necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White Acacia</span>, <i>Robinia pseudo-acacia</i>.—North American.
Grows to a height of 25 metres by 0·60 metre in diameter; when
dry, the wood is excellent, and is used for coach-building, cabinet-making,
etc. It grows well, especially in mixed woods, as the
saplings are utilized. In timber plantations it must be planted
singly as it overruns the ground in a short time. To be sown in
rows 25 or 30 kilogs. to the hectare, without any mixture.
From the strongest and straightest specimens stock trees are
chosen, the others are cut down to the ground every two, twelve
or eighteen years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Willow</span>, <i>Salix</i>.—The willow is very useful for planting woods
in damp or low-lying places in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and
9th regions. It is grown from grafting twigs, a metre apart,
anywhere. The weeping willow, <i>S. babylonica</i>, gives fuel which
sells well. The osier willow, <i>S. purpurea</i>, <i>S. rubra</i>, <i>S. vitellina</i>,
<i>S. viminalis</i> and <i>S. amygdalina</i>, furnish fine and common osiers,
which are so much used in basket-making of every kind, and for
light wicker furniture for the garden and the beach. It is one
of the chief products of the Paraná Islands and others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elm Tree</span>, <i>Ulmus</i>.—The elms we possess belong to the species
<i>U. campestris</i>, L., and <i>U. montana</i>, Burch, both from Europe.
They attain a height of 40 metres by 1 metre in diameter, and
grow well on cool gravelly soil. The elm in general is more
suited to the hills or declivities than to the plains. It is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
hardy and long-lived. Its timber is excellent for coach-building,
and some parts of it for cabinet-making. It is a good species
for stock, in suitable places, in the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 7th and some
parts of the 9th region. It is sown as soon as the seeds ripen on
well-tilled soil, either in furrows or plots.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Exotic Forest Trees which it would be well to
Introduce</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Fir Tree.</span>—The most interesting species are:—</p>

<p><i>A. amabilis</i> and <i>A. balsamea</i>, from North America, grows

<p><i>A. religiosa</i>, Lindl.—From Mexico. Attains 40 to 50 metres
in height by 1 or 2 metres in diameter; 2nd and 3rd regions.</p>

<p>All fir trees require hilly ground already stocked with trees.
It is useless to plant them on the open plain. Other conifers,
known also as firs, belong to the genera <i>Picea</i> and <i>Tsuga</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maple Tree.</span>—The <i>Acer campestre</i> and <i>A. platanoides</i>.—From
Europe, appear to be suited for our 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th
regions, the latter as a stock species. Thirty feet high.</p>

<p>The <i>A. eriocarpum</i>, Michx., and <i>A. rubrum</i>, Michx., are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
handsome species from North America, where they grow to a
height of 20 to 35 metres by 1 metre in diameter.</p>

<p>To be essayed in the same regions as the preceding trees.
They require deep soil and are cultivated like the sycamore
maple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alders.</span> The <i>Alnus cordifolia</i>, Ten.—From Europe, and
<i>A. orientalis</i>, Dcne., from Asia. Would grow well in the 7th
region and on the shores of the 5th, 6th and 9th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Araucarias.</span> The <i>Araucaria Bidwilli</i>, Hook, and <i>A. Cunninghami</i>,
Ait., both from Eastern Australia. Grow to a height of
50 to 60 metres and give excellent timber; 2nd, 3rd and 4th
regions.</p>

40 metres in height; 1st, 2nd and 4th regions.</p>

<p>All grow on deep, humid soil, rich in vegetable mould, like
certain parts of the Chaco and of the 1st and 2nd regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birches.</span>—Valuable trees for the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and
9th regions. Do not exceed 30 metres in height on the best soil,
but very hardy and reach a metre in diameter. The best species
are <i>Betula alba</i>, <i>B. nigra</i>, <i>B. lenta</i> and <i>B. pubescens</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">American Walnut Trees.</span>—All give excellent timber, strong
and hardier than the European kinds. Could be planted and
sown in regions 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. The best species for woods
are <i>Carya alba</i>, Nut., and <i>C. amara</i>, from Canada. <i>C. olivæformis</i>
and <i>C. porcina</i> from the central states of North America. <i>C.
tomentosa</i>, Nutt., is popularly known in North America as
Hickory.</p>

<p>Tall trees, generally very leafy, and suitable for stock in mixed
woods and for special wood planting, together with European
and Asiatic species, cultivated like the common walnut, <i>J. regia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cedars.</span>—All cedars give very fine wood known as cedar-wood,
whence the confusion with real cedar belonging to the
conifera family.</p>

<p>The Red Cedar of Australia, <i>Cedrela australis</i>, Muell., grows
to 60 metres in height. May be planted in the 1st and 2nd regions
together with the one we have, <i>C. brasiliensis</i>. <i>C. sinensis</i>,
A. Juss, seems more suitable for the 3rd and 5th regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chamæyparis.</span>—This resinous tree gives excellent timber in
the United States, where it grows to a height of 25 to 30 metres
by 0·60 metre in diameter. The species <i>C. Lawsoniana</i> and
<i>C. Nutkænsis</i>, from North America, as well as <i>C. obtusa</i>, Endl.,
from Japan, appear to be suitable for dense woods in regions
4, 5 and 6.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dacrydium.</span>—Indigenous to Tasmania and New Zealand.
The forest species furnish good carpentry timber. From some
descriptions of Chilian conifers it would seem that some of these
are very like Dacrydium.</p>

<p>The most interesting species are <i>D. cupressinum</i>, Soland,
<i>D. Franklinii</i> and <i>D. Kirkii</i>, F. v. M.</p>

<p>These trees grow to a height of 40 to 60 metres and require
very generous soil, rather damp and warm, like that of the 1st
and 2nd regions in our country. To be cultivated as the <i>Araucaria
brasiliensis</i> or Misiones pine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diospyros.</span>—The <i>D. lotus</i>, from Italy, and <i>D. Virginiana</i>
furnish valuable timber know as ebony. They do not exceed
20 to 25 metres in height. A trial might be made in the 2nd,
3rd, 4th, 5th and 7th regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drimys</span>, <i>D. Winter</i>, Forst.—A Chilian tree 15 to 20 metres in
height, gives winter bark, used in medicine. To be tried for
mixed woods in the 3rd, 4th and 5th regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beech</span>, <i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, L.—A European tree 30 metres in
height by half a metre in diameter; gives excellent wood for
boxes and wooden partitions or anything not exposed to the
weather. A first-class species for the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 9th
regions as a stock tree in tall woods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ash Tree.</span>—The <i>Fraxinus americana</i>, L., <i>F. quadrangularis</i>,
Michx., <i>F. sambucifolia</i>, Lam.—From North America, are trees
of 30 to 35 metres in height by 0·60 to 1 metre in diameter.
The timber is highly prized for coach-building and other special
work. It appears suitable for mixed woods in 5th, 6th and 7th
regions, where it may be grown like the common ash tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Walnut Tree</span>, <i>Juglans nigra</i>, L.—From North
America, where it attains 40 metres in height by 1 metre in
diameter. Though its wood is not so valuable as common
walnut, it is very pretty and fine-grained. It might be planted
and grown in the same regions as the other kinds of walnut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juniper Tree</span>, <i>Juniperus virginiana</i>, L.—From 25 to 30
metres high by 1 metre in diameter, growing in North American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
forests. The wood is very nice, and used by cabinet-makers,
etc. This conifer appears suitable for dense woods in the 3rd,
5th and 6th regions, with Lambertiana and other cypresses, and
is grown in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larch Tree.</span>—The European <i>Larix europea</i>, L., and the
American <i>L. microcarpa</i> are hardy species of 25 to 40 metres in
height by 1 metre in diameter, with deciduous leaves, which
makes its transport easy; 5th, 6th and 8th regions; in tall
woods with other conifers. Grown like the Spruce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spruces.</span>—Great conifers of the cold regions of North America.
The most suitable species for woods, besides the <i>P. excelsa</i>,
Linck., which we already grow, are the <i>P. alba</i>, Linck., from
Canada, <i>P. Engelmanii</i>, Car., from the Rocky Mountains,
<i>P. morinda</i>, Linck., from the Himalayas, and <i>P. nigra</i>, Linck.,
from Northern America. The latter species is suitable for the
6th and 9th regions; the others for the 5th and 6th, grown
as firs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Libocedrus Decurrens</span>, Torr.—From California, where it
grows to 40 metres in height, over a metre in diameter, is very
strong and gives excellent timber. Appears suitable for afforestation
together with the Chilian variety in the 3rd, 4th, 5th and
7th regions.</p>

<p>To be sown and cultivated like the Lambertiana cypress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tulip Tree</span>, or <span class="smcap">Whitewood</span>, <i>Liriodendrum tulipifera</i>, L.—From
North America, where it attains a height of 60 metres by
3 and 4 metres in diameter. Gives good wood and appears
suitable for growing in tall woods on deep and humid soil in
regions 4, 5, 6 and 7.</p>

<p>To be sown thickly in furrows or in beds for transplanting
when a year old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pine Trees.</span>—We already have different kinds of pine trees
which flourish in woods. It would be well to introduce the better
species, because we lack such as <i>Pinus australis</i>, Michx., from
Carolina and Florida, where it grows to 35 to 40 metres in height.
This is the species which gives the timber known as pitchpine.</p>

<p><i>P. Benthamiana</i>, Hartw.—From California. 70 metres in
height by 2 metres in diameter. Good timber.</p>

<p><i>P. excelsa</i>, Wall.—From the Himalayas. 40 metres in height.</p>

<p><i>P. Jeffreyana</i>, V. H.; <i>P. Lambertiana</i>, Doug.; <i>P. Sabiniana</i>,
Doug.; and <i>P. Torreyana</i>, all from California.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p><i>P. Strobus</i>, L.—From North America. A hardy tree 40 metres
in height by 1 metre in diameter.</p>

<p>The Californian species might be tried in the 4th, 5th, 6th and
8th regions. The Himalayan species on the mountain ranges
of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th, and the last-named species in the
5th, 6th and 8th. That from the Carolinas might be grown
together with <i>P. insignis</i>.</p>

<p>To be grown in woods of the same kind in the same regions
and in the same way as those we have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Planera Crenata</span>, Desf.—A tree from the Caucasians;
excellent timber and very hardy.</p>

<p>Grown like the elm and in the same regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caucasian Walnut Tree</span>, <i>Pterocarya caucasica</i> and <i>P.
Spachiand</i>.—Trees 20 metres in height, magnificent timber and
suitable for intermingling with other walnut trees, especially
Carya species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sequoia.</span>—From California, where it grows to 80 or 100 metres
in height by 5 or 6 metres in diameter. The species <i>S. gigantea</i>
is that which attains the greatest size; the <i>S. sempervirens</i> is
more modest and less exacting about the nature of the soil and
its situation. The former requires porous, deep and rather
clayey soil, situated on hills or in ravines. To be tried in the
3rd and 6th regions and on the mountains in the 4th and 5th.
Grown as the pine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lime Tree.</span>—The different European and North American
species, <i>Tilia argentea</i>, Desf., <i>T. nigra</i>, Burk, and <i>T. silvestris</i>
from Europe, might be planted in the 5th, 6th and 7th regions
in heavy, porous, clay soil.</p>

<p><i>Tsuga douglasi</i> (Fir).—From Colorado State, North America.
Attains a height of 50 metres and furnishes excellent timber.
Suitable for planting woods together with spruces and firs, and
grown in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">American Elm Tree</span>, <i>Ulmus americanus</i>, L.—This is a very
hardy species at least 30 metres high. Its timber, though not
so very good, is yet used in carriage-building and the like.
Grown like other elm species and in the same regions.</p>

</div>

<p>Lest it should be thought that a disproportionate amount
of space has been allotted here to this matter of forestry it
must be pointed out that timber of all kinds constitutes one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of the greatest of the still latent treasures of the River Plate.
A treasure which could be easily realized but which has
hitherto been extraordinarily neglected not only in practice
but even by most writers on the countries in question.</p>

<p>Argentina will one day export timber and ornamental
woods instead of importing them as she has done hitherto;
and perhaps the present difficulties of maritime transport
will help to turn the eyes of both Republics to the wealth of
building and other timber and fine woods they have at hand.</p>

<p>A visit to the coach-making works of those of the River
Plate Railway Companies which manufacture their own
luxurious saloon and sleeping cars, would alone suffice to
astonish many people by the beauty and value of the native
woods there used, both in the cabinet-maker’s art and in the
most solid portions of construction destined to resist exceptional
strain.</p>

<p>Señor Mauduit has already been quoted on the subject of
the need of shade for cattle. A need which estancieros now
pretty fully appreciate.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">LITERATURE AND ART</span></h2>

<p>As in most young countries, the Muses have in Argentina
and Uruguay had to be content chiefly with
the imported offerings of foreign writers, artists
and composers; while native science has principally been
confined to medicine and surgery and various branches of
rural productiveness. Still the River Plate Territories have
always had their historians and poets, and recent generations
have produced some painters, sculptors and composers.</p>

<p>The Histories of Mitre and Araújo are admirable literary
monuments to the glory of the River Plate Territories and
the memory of their authors. The poetry of the lately
deceased Guido y Spano and of the still living Zorrilla de
San Martin occupies a deservedly high place in modern
literature; while the names of Juan Cruz Varela, José
Mármol and José Hernandez (the author of the Lyrics of
Gaucho life published under the title of “Martin Fierro”)
will ever remain household words on the River Plate.</p>

<p>Godofredo Daireaux and Leopoldo Lugones are typical
and delightful writers whose sketches are faithful vignettes
of the manners and customs, landscapes and sentiment
of a century and half a century ago, of times
of heroic battles and early peaceful progress. For the
rest, one must, with the Muses, wait with such patience
as one may for the appearance of National types of
literature and art; types probably only to be formed when
the National types of men and women have reached their
fully distinct development out of existing cosmopolitan chaos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
At present Argentine and Uruguayan Art and Literature<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> are
chiefly imitative; music, painting and novels being mostly
exaggerations of, often not the best, ephemeral European
taste and fashions, while architecture usually alternates
fidelity to stucco with trivially fantastic French “Villa”
and “Château” styles.</p>

<p>Novelists seek to make one’s flesh creep; Painters to
outvie either incomprehensibility or banality; Architects
achieve futility and Musicians are reminiscent of everything
except the sad charm of melody which is their natural inheritance,
through the <i lang="es">Payadores</i>, from Moorish Spain.
The old intervals and harmonies are carefully eschewed in
favour of anything, no matter what, which may seem to
have a piquant flavour of “art nouveau.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, nature sometimes will out and the old-time
moods now and again penetrate the covering of pseudo-Viennese
melody and modern Italian harmonies under which
the composer has sought to hide his natural gifts and
atavistic inspiration.</p>

<p>It is only in the theatre that the true native genius is
allowed full play. Some of the real Argentine dramas and
comedies are refreshingly delightful in their truth of characterization,
sentiment and humour. All is of the soil, true to
type and racy. But such things are only played at minor
houses and in rural districts. Fashion knows them not, nor
desires to know them, while Italian and French operatic
and dramatic companies hold the boards of the leading
theatres at prices which make it quite obligatory for all the
best people to be seen frequently in their boxes or stalls.
Still the minor theatre is the casket of the one true jewel in
Argentine Art which shines with its inherent native brilliance.</p>

<p>Unless, perhaps, florid oratory may be termed an Art.
If so, it is one which has a wide vogue throughout South
America. Few events are there allowed to pass without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
lengthy and vigorous “Discursos”; the real or simulated
passion of which rings strangely false in Anglo-Saxon ears.
Much virtue, however, lies in accepted convention, and the
South American sees nothing comic or discordant in a frock-coated
orator doing his best to turn over a sheaf of manuscript
with one hand whilst he indulges in what to us is
painfully exaggerated gesticulation with the rest of his
body. On the contrary, the bravas of the audience which
punctuate the barn-storming enunciation of the most high-flown
sentiments are evidently and whole-heartedly sincere
expressions of admiration for, at least, the speaker’s mastery
of the declamatory art. Discursos are, in South America, the
inevitable accompaniment of every event of any mark, from
a funeral to the announcement of a dividend.</p>

<p>It is part of the Hero Worship which has so large a place
in the Latin nature. A worship none the less fervent because
the enjoyment of it by its living object is frequently as brief
as it must be sweet. Once dead, of course, a hero is one for
ever if he have attained his niche at some prominent period
of his country’s history. Great Presidents live perennially in
the knowledge of every school child, and one bad one is still
honoured by reference to his name and attributes in the
comic journals whenever an unflattering comparison to a
living politician is sought. Rozas and Artígas have their
true meed of mingled praise and blame.</p>

<p>But all this digresses from the heading of this chapter;
through, perhaps, an unconscious effort on the author’s part
to eke out an as yet somewhat barren subject.</p>

<p>The truth is that no country nor individual has ever
produced much art of any account during its or his infancy.
And Argentina and Uruguay are still in the barely adolescent
stage of their economic and political development. The
many sympathetic, though often contrasted, characteristics
of the true Argentine and Uruguayan hold out, however,
good hope for artistic achievement in the future. The facts
that Argentina has already one truly native sculptress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
more than mediocre talent in Lola Mora, and one master of
the art of word-painting in illustration of the old-world
charm of some of the people and scenery of various distant
parts of the Republic in Leopoldo Lugunes must not be lost
sight of. Nor must the further one that the poetic spirit of
the past which still broods over the wide Pampa has been
caught and crystallized by Godofredo Daireaux in his
<cite>Tipos y Paisages Argentinos</cite> and other delicate allegories
and sketches. The River Plate awaits a native W. C. Cable
to write a rosary of tales of the Old Colonial Days of the
Puerto de Santa Maria de los Buenos Aires, of Vice-Regal
balls, of high-combed, mantilla-coifed and beflounced belles
in seringa and orange blossom scented gardens; of sighs
and vows breathed between window bars; of times the
politely veneered roughness of which has been softened for
us by the haze of remoteness; a haze which soon will have
produced complete obliteration if some living, understanding
brain does not quickly record their outlines and fill these in
with appropriate tints.</p>

<p>Someone will, must, do this. But no stranger. Only a
native genius, daintily contemplative, can, as a labour of
love, bring back to life the <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i> days of South
America before its Colonists awakened to the shrill call of
Liberty and Independence.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
